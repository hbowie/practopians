					<p><p>It may be too early to know who will win on Tuesday, but it&rsquo;s not too early to assess the major issues roiling the electorate and offer a few thoughts about what needs to happen after the voting is over &ndash; no matter who comes out on top.</p></p>

						Developmental Levels as Evolving Social Structures
					</a></h3>
					<p><p>As human society has evolved over the centuries, we have developed different types of social structures. None of the later structures replace earlier ones, yet each new structure has been devised in order to confer some new sort of evolutionary advantage to our species &ndash; in other words, to help us survive and thrive more effectively.</p></p>

						Human Nature
					</a></h3>
					<p><p>What does it mean to be human? This must certainly be a foundational question for all of us, when contemplating almost any aspect of our existence. And while any brief answer to this question must admittedly be no more than a starting point for further discussion, I think it perhaps worthwhile to provide such a beginning. And so, here they are: the primary traits we share that I think make us uniquely human.</p></p>

						The Four Quadrants of Human Knowledge

					<p><p>I first came across Ken Wilber&rsquo;s work late in the last century when a friend handed me a copy of <cite>A Brief History of Everything</cite> as a birthday present. Wilber has described four quadrants of human knowledge, each representing a different and valid perspective on the same reality.</p></p>

					<p><p>When it comes to religion, I have to confess to being a bit of a mongrel. My mother was a Methodist. My father was a nudist. And I once called myself an immortalist. These days I choose not to align myself with any particular religious group.</p></p>

						The Nature of God
					</a></h3>
					<p><p>Human records indicate that some sort of belief in a God or collection of gods is a feature of almost all human culture. No matter what the continent or age, a belief in powerful, supernatural beings that somehow influence human existence is a near-constant. At the same time, though, many skeptics have persistently questioned the existence of such a being, and beliefs about the attributes of God have exhibited wide variation, with such variations often being so deeply held that wars have been fought to advance one sort of belief over another. Rather than approach the question of God&rsquo;s existence directly, it seems wiser to ask ourselves how we can best explain the facts above &ndash; the combination of a nearly universal human belief in God, combined with so far irreconcilable differences in what sort of God we believe in.</p></p>

						Reasons for Belief
					</a></h3>
					<p><p>We often seem to assume that people say things, and come to believe them, because they are true. It seems to me, though, that people take up beliefs for a whole host of reasons, and the likely truth or falsehood of these statements is often the least of the motivating factors at work. Here then, are the multifarious reasons why people may choose to believe something.</p></p>

						The Systemic Era
					</a></h3>
					<p><p>We tend to divide up human history into relatively neat periods, and give them names like &ldquo;The Agrarian Era,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Age of Industrialization&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Information Age.&rdquo; When I look at what&rsquo;s going on around me today and try to make sense of it, I am forced to draw the conclusion that we are deep into an as yet unnamed age that I would call &ldquo;The Systemic Era.&rdquo; What I mean by this is that we are now at a point where the human condition is much more influenced by vast social and economic systems of our own collective making than by any natural forces or conditions, or any individual actions we might take, or even any individual intentions we might have.</p></p>
