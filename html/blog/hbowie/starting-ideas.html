<p>On this Web site I wish to propose and develop a Practical Utopian belief system. </p>
<p>I think of this system of beliefs as a modern, open-source religion, without the god. </p>
<p>I propose the Practopian belief system as consisting of the following elements. </p>
<h2>1. No Hand on the Tiller Other than our Own</h2>
<h2>2. A Global Human Perspective.</h2>
<h2>3. Balance the Books.</h2>

<p><em>The Practical Utopian</em> is an evolving set of writings describing a particular approach to the human condition. <em>Practopian</em> is a convenient contraction, and the published writings are available at <a href="http://www.practopian.org">Practopian.org</a>, while the source materials are available at <a href="https://github.com/hbowie/practopian">github.com/hbowie/practopian</a>.</p>
<p>The core tenets of this philosophy are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p>Our interests are global in scope; that is, while we also recognize the importance of local and national perspectives, we are not interested in simply pushing problems from one part of the globe to another &ndash; we are interested in the condition of the world as a whole.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Our interests are long-term; that is, while we also recognize the importance of the here and now, and the importance of short-term results, we are ultimately focused on conditions as we can expect them to evolve into the future, certainly beyond our own life spans. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Our perspective is a human one; that is, while we are concerned about the conditions and fates of other species as well, our values are ultimately rooted in a concern for the human condition. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>We embrace science; we do not see the scientific method, or modern scientific beliefs, as posing any fundamental contradiction to any other elements of our philosophy. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>We embrace the inner realities of human existence; that is, while we are comfortable taking an external, objective, view of reality, we are also comfortable considering an inner, subjective view of that same reality. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>We generally favor a systems approach to addressing problems; that is, rather than treat the symptoms, or simply single out the latest players in the drama, &hellip;.</p></li>
  <li>
  <p>We care about outcomes; what happens matter to us, and we believe that some outcomes are better than others. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>We believe that our actions, both individually and collectively, can influence those outcomes. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>In order to advance our interests, we neither place our trust in, nor relinquish our responsibilities to, any non-human agent, whether such an agent be called God, Evolution, or anything else. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>Although every stage in human development has resulted in some losses, as well as some benefits, and although progress never occurs in a straight line, on the whole we believe that human development throughout our history has resulted in overall forward movement &ndash; progress, if you like &ndash; and that continued progress is desirable, even if the optimal direction and pace of forward movement is a matter of continuing debate. However, we do not believe that continued forward progress &ndash; or even maintenance of our current state of development &ndash; is assured. </p></li>
  <li>
  <p>We believe that our culture is malleable; that is, while our shared beliefs, values and practices provide a framework in which we operate, our culture is also ultimately a human construct that we can shape in order to produce better outcomes for humanity in the future. </p></li>

<p>While <em>The Practical Utopian</em> is currently the sole work of <a href="http://www.herbbowie.com">Herb Bowie</a>, I invite others to participate in the creation and dissemination of these writings, and ultimately hope to further these efforts through the establishment of a non-profit organization, to be called the Society for Practical Utopians. </p>
