<p>Here are a few other thoughts that are occurring to me after the recent US elections.</p>
<h2>1. The United States is a big, geographically diverse country.</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m hearing some grousing out there about how unfair it is that parts of the country that are so sparsely populated can have such a disproportionate impact on election results. </p>
<p>Well&hellip; where did you think you were living? We have fifty states in this country. They are all different. They won&rsquo;t all fit on one of the coasts. And it&rsquo;s 3,000 miles from one side of the country to the other. And our founding fathers went out of their way to ensure that the more populous states would not be able to overpower the less populous ones &ndash; which is why we have two Senators for every state, and why the Senate has as much power as the House of Representatives. And why many state legislatures are similarly constituted. </p>
<p>And, if the big cities now have so many more people than the rural parts of the country.. well, maybe that&rsquo;s part of the problem. If the large middle part of our country has been so hollowed out economically that the younger generation has to move to the cities to find work and prosperity, then maybe there&rsquo;s a problem there we all need to look at. </p>
<p>And, one more thing&hellip; if those in the cities are so big on diversity, then the least we can do is welcome our rural cousins into the big tent where we&rsquo;re so busy embracing all our other minorities. </p>
<h2>2. The Primary Role of Leadership</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth remembering that the primary role of leadership &ndash; in any group or organization &ndash; is to look out for the welfare of others in the group. People band together because they can provide for themselves more effectively by working together than they can by each working independently. But any group needs leaders in order to help them organize effectively. If the members of a group feel that their leaders are not looking out for them, or are not able to organize them effectively&hellip; then they are liable to look for new leaders. </p>
<p>It really doesn&rsquo;t take much more than this simple truth to understand why Trump won, and Hillary lost. </p>

  <li>What Divides Us
    <p>There&rsquo;s been lots of post-election analysis trying to figure out how so many people could have voted for Trump, and what makes them so different from the rest of us. </p>
