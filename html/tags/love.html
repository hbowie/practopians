<p>Love is a <a href="../core/principles.html">Core Principle</a>.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Although we cannot define the meaning of the word in any comprehensive way &ndash; or, perhaps, <em>because</em> we cannot fully define it &ndash; we believe in <strong><a href="../tags/love.html">love</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Let us call love the apprehension of something outside of oneself, some being or form that is other than our self, and yet that affirms the possibility of a greater unity of which we are each but parts, a unity that leaves us still ourselves, and yet also part of something inestimably greater.</p>
<p>This intense feeling of deep affection may be felt in the presence of another person, or a group of people, or a work of art, or another living creature, or some element of the natural world, or in the embrace of the entire world around us.</p>
<p>We want to help shape a world in which there is more of this stuff: more love.</p>
