<p>We strive to achieve our <a href="../core/mission.html">Mission</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Practopians seek to identify and promote beliefs, principles, values and actions that will result in a brighter future for humanity. We strive to combine a clear-eyed view of what is possible with an idealistic yearning for a better tomorrow. By documenting in an inclusive and transparent manner a foundational modern worldview, we hope to launch something that might be thought of as the world&rsquo;s first open-source religion. We will work to advance our cause through authoring, publication, education, scientific advocacy, and promotion of literature and the arts as vital elements of human culture. </p>
