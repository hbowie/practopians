critical thinking, diversity, liberty, society	Chris Argyris and Donald Schön	Theory in Practice: Increasing Personal Effectiveness	3	Book	Copyright	1974	1555424465	Model II Decision-Making	<p> Model II encourages the individual to maximize his uniqueness. If, in doing so, he should arrive at goals that differ from those developed by others, he will have done so under conditions of openness, trust and risk-taking. The individual would therefore feel free to discuss his differences openly with the group. Moreover, if the individual is in a subordinate power position, and if he feels he had adequate opportunity to dissuade the group and that the group publicly confronted and tested all differences, then the individual will probably be motivated to work toward the group goal but still be motivated to generate new information that may change the group's decision. This means that one can be externally committed to a decision and internally committed to the decision-making processes that produced the decision yet simultaneously monitor the consequences of the decision thoroughly to seek new, valid information to reconfront the decision without being considered disloyal. In the model-II world, conflicts do not disappear&#8212;indeed, the illusion of conflict disappearing is more typical of the model-I world, in which conflicts are settled by power plays based on sanctions, charisma or loyalty. </p>	John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.					2008-10-18T11:12:38-07:00		9	Jossey-Bass Publishers	San Francisco	103	chris-argyris-and-donald-schn	Chris_Argyris_and_Donald_Schön	Argyris, Chris and Schön, Donald	Chris <strong>Argyris</strong> and Donald <strong>Schön</strong>	<a href='../tags/critical-thinking.html' rel='tag'>critical thinking</a>, <a href='../tags/diversity.html' rel='tag'>diversity</a>, <a href='../tags/liberty.html' rel='tag'>liberty</a>, <a href='../tags/society.html' rel='tag'>society</a>	<a href='../wisdom/tags/critical-thinking.html' rel='tag'>critical thinking</a>, <a href='../wisdom/tags/diversity.html' rel='tag'>diversity</a>, <a href='../wisdom/tags/liberty.html' rel='tag'>liberty</a>, <a href='../wisdom/tags/society.html' rel='tag'>society</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>Theory in Practice: Increasing Personal Effectiveness</cite>, <span class='city'>San Francisco</span>: <span class='publisher'>Jossey-Bass Publishers</span>, <span class='datepublished'>1974</span>, page&nbsp;<span class='pages'>103</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1555424465/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>1555424465</a> 	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>1974</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>John Wiley &amp;amp; Sons, Inc.</span>

Austin	Measuring and Managing Performance in Organizations	3	Book	Copyright	1996	0932633366	Cockpits with Instruments Controlled by Gremlins	<p> One frequent analogy casts the manager in the role of an airplane pilot guided by organizational measures that are like cockpit instruments. </p> <p> Mechanistic and organic analogies are flawed because they are too simplistic. Kaplan and Norton's cockpit analogy would be more accurate if it included a multitude of tiny gremlins controlling wing flaps, fuel flow, and so on of a plane being buffeted by winds and generally struggling against nature, but with the gremlins always controlling information flow back to the cockpit instruments, for fear that the pilot might find gremlin replacements. It would not be surprising if airplanes guided this way occasionally flew into mountainsides when they seemed to be progressing smoothly toward their destinations. </p>	Robert D.

He doesn't think consistency of thought is a particularly positive trait. It's perfectly healthy &#8212; encouraged, even &#8212; to have an idea tomorrow that contradicted your idea today. </p> <p> He's observed that the smartest people are constantly revising their understanding, reconsidering a problem they thought they'd already solved. They're open to new points of view, new information, new ideas, contradictions, and challenges to their own way of thinking. </p> <p> This doesn't mean you shouldn't have a well formed point of view, but it means you should consider your point of view as temporary. </p> <p> What trait signified someone who was <em>wrong</em> a lot of the time?

It wasn't surprising, really. The idea that drugs, sex and music could transform the world was always a pretty naïve dream. As the counter-culture's effect on the mainstream grew, its own values and aesthetics decayed. The political setbacks of the coming years grabbed the headlines while the dilution of ideals happened more quietly, but nonetheless vividly for those who noticed. </p>	Joe Boyd					2008-11-02T08:45:15-08:00		30	Serpent's Tail	London	164	joe-boyd	Joe_Boyd	Boyd, Joe	Joe <strong>Boyd</strong>	<a href='../tags/cultural-evolution.html' rel='tag'>cultural evolution</a>	<a href='../wisdom/tags/cultural-evolution.html' rel='tag'>cultural evolution</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>White Bicycles: Making Music in the 1960s</cite>, <span class='city'>London</span>: <span class='publisher'>Serpent&apos;s Tail</span>, <span class='datepublished'>2006</span>, page&nbsp;<span class='pages'>164</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1852429100/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>1852429100</a> 	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>2006</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>Joe Boyd</span>

We tried to pierce the veil of time and grasp what it sounded, felt, looked and smelled like. In Harvard Square and London I met many with similar preoccupations; they didn't seem unusual at all. When old blues singers began to reappear, it delivered a rush of excitement and adrenalin. Meeting and traveling with Gary Davis and Lonnie Johnson &#8212; even Coleman Hawkins &#8212; armoured me against a host of disappointments. </p> <p> History today seems more like a postmodern collage; we are surrounded by two-dimensional representations of our heritage. Access via Amazon.com or iPod to all those boxed sets of old blues singers &#8212; or Nick Drake, for that matter &#8212; doesn't equate with the sense of discovery and connection we experienced. </p>	Joe Boyd					2008-11-02T07:13:25-08:00		32	Serpent's Tail	London	268-269	joe-boyd	Joe_Boyd	Boyd, Joe	Joe <strong>Boyd</strong>	<a href='../tags/art.html' rel='tag'>art</a>	<a href='../wisdom/tags/art.html' rel='tag'>art</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>White Bicycles: Making Music in the 1960s</cite>, <span class='city'>London</span>: <span class='publisher'>Serpent&apos;s Tail</span>, <span class='datepublished'>2006</span>, pages&nbsp;<span class='pages'>268-269</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1852429100/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>1852429100</a> 	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>2006</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>Joe Boyd</span>
art	Joe Boyd	White Bicycles: Making Music in the 1960s	3	Book	Copyright	2006	1852429100	Little I recognized as music	<p> Thirty years after Brighton, I walked sadly away from the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Fair. It was everything my twenty-one-year-old self might have dreamed of: 75,000 people packed into the Fairgrounds, with NPR-subscriber bags holding expertly marked programmes. America's black musical heritage was on parade across two long weekends and eight stages. But the audience was almost entirely white. The performers had learned their lessons, dropping any modernizations or slick showbiz gestures and recreating the old-time styles the sophisticated audiences craved. On one level, it demonstrated respect for a deep culture and a rejection of shallow novelty. But removed from the soil in which it grew the music felt lifeless, like actors portraying characters who happened to be their younger selves. In two days wandering from stage to stage, I heard little I recognized as music. </p>	Joe Boyd					2008-11-02T09:33:08-08:00		33	Serpent's Tail	London	44	joe-boyd	Joe_Boyd	Boyd, Joe	Joe <strong>Boyd</strong>	<a href='../tags/art.html' rel='tag'>art</a>	<a href='../wisdom/tags/art.html' rel='tag'>art</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>White Bicycles: Making Music in the 1960s</cite>, <span class='city'>London</span>: <span class='publisher'>Serpent&apos;s Tail</span>, <span class='datepublished'>2006</span>, page&nbsp;<span class='pages'>44</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1852429100/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>1852429100</a> 	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>2006</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>Joe Boyd</span>

art, connection	Joe Boyd	White Bicycles: Making Music in the 1960s	3	Book	Copyright	2006	1852429100	Records we made together in the sixties	<p> These days most engineers confronted with a displeasing sound reach for the knobs on the console and tweak the high, mid or low frequencies. When that process is inflicted on more and more tracks of a multi-channel recording the sound passes through dozens of transistors, resulting in a narrower, more confined sound. With the added limitations of digital sound, you end up with a bright and shiny, thin and two-dimensional recording. To my ears anyway. </p> <p> When John [Wood] heard a sound he didn't like, he would lift his bulky frame off the chair and lumber down the stairs, muttering all the way. I began to be able to predict whether he was going to try a different microphone, reposition the existing one or shift the offending musician to another part of the studio. When I listen to records we made together in the sixties, I can still hear the air in the studio and the full dimension of the sounds the musicians created for us. I can hear the depth of Nick Drake's breath as well as his voice, the grit in the crude strings of Robin Williamson's <cite>gimbri</cite> and Dave Mattacks&#8217; drum technique spread out warmly in aural Technicolor across the stereo spectrum. </p>	Joe Boyd					2008-11-02T08:12:54-08:00		35	Serpent's Tail	London	204-205	joe-boyd	Joe_Boyd	Boyd, Joe	Joe <strong>Boyd</strong>	<a href='../tags/art.html' rel='tag'>art</a>, <a href='../tags/connection.html' rel='tag'>connection</a>	<a href='../wisdom/tags/art.html' rel='tag'>art</a>, <a href='../wisdom/tags/connection.html' rel='tag'>connection</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>White Bicycles: Making Music in the 1960s</cite>, <span class='city'>London</span>: <span class='publisher'>Serpent&apos;s Tail</span>, <span class='datepublished'>2006</span>, pages&nbsp;<span class='pages'>204-205</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1852429100/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>1852429100</a> 	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>2006</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>Joe Boyd</span>

It was a time of unprecedented prosperity. People are supposedly wealthier now, yet most feel they haven't enough money and time is at an even greater premium.... In the sixties, we had surpluses of both money and time. </p> <p> Friends of mine lived comfortably in Greenwich Village, Harvard Square, Bayswater, Santa Monica and on the Left Bank and were, by current standards, broke. Yet they survived easily on occasional coffee-house gigs or part-time work. Today, urbanites must feverishly maximize their economic potential just to maintain a small flat in Hoboken, Somerville, Hackney, Korea Town or Belleville. The economy of the sixties cut us a lot of slack, leaving time to travel, take drugs, write songs and rethink the universe. </p>	Joe Boyd					2008-11-02T07:28:14-08:00		36	Serpent's Tail	London	267	joe-boyd	Joe_Boyd	Boyd, Joe	Joe <strong>Boyd</strong>	<a href='../tags/cultural-evolution.html' rel='tag'>cultural evolution</a>	<a href='../wisdom/tags/cultural-evolution.html' rel='tag'>cultural evolution</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>White Bicycles: Making Music in the 1960s</cite>, <span class='city'>London</span>: <span class='publisher'>Serpent&apos;s Tail</span>, <span class='datepublished'>2006</span>, page&nbsp;<span class='pages'>267</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1852429100/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>1852429100</a> 	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>2006</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>Joe Boyd</span>

governance, progress	G. K. Chesterton	Illustrated London News	3	unknown		1924		Conservatives and Progressives	<p> The whole modern world has divided itself into Conservatives and Progressives. The business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of Conservatives is to prevent mistakes from being corrected. Even when the revolutionist might himself repent of his revolution, the traditionalist is already defending it as part of his tradition. Thus we have two great types &#8212; the advanced person who rushes us into ruin, and the retrospective person who admires the ruins. He admires them especially by moonlight, not to say moonshine. Each new blunder of the progressive or prig becomes instantly a legend of immemorial antiquity for the snob. This is called the balance, or mutual check, in our Constitution. </p>						2011-04-22T06:06:37-07:00		55				g-k-chesterton	G._K._Chesterton	Chesterton, G. K.	G.

He is not a mystic; and therefore he has a tendency to go mad. Men talk of the extravagances and frenzies that have been produced by mysticism; they are a mere drop in the bucket. In the main, and from the beginning of time, mysticism has kept men sane. The thing that has driven them mad was logic. ...The only thing that has kept the race of men from the mad extremes of the convent and the pirate-galley, the night-club and the lethal chamber, has been mysticism&#8212; the belief that logic is misleading, and that things are not what they seem. </p>						2011-04-22T06:04:28-07:00		57				g-k-chesterton	G._K._Chesterton	Chesterton, G.

There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away. To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it. </p>						2011-04-22T06:14:33-07:00		58				g-k-chesterton	G._K._Chesterton	Chesterton, G. K.	G.

humanism, wonder	G. K. Chesterton	unknown	3	unknown				We are in Eden still	<p> There runs a strange law through the length of human history &#8212; that men are continually tending to undervalue their environment, to undervalue their happiness, to undervalue themselves. The great sin of mankind, the sin typified by the fall of Adam, is the tendency, not towards pride, but towards this weird and horrible humility. </p> <p> This is the great fall, the fall by which the fish forgets the sea, the ox forgets the meadow, the clerk forgets the city, every man forgets his environment and, in the fullest and most literal sense, forgets himself. This is the real fall of Adam, and it is a spiritual fall. It is a strange thing that many truly spiritual men, such as General Gordon, have actually spent some hours in speculating upon the precise location of the Garden of Eden. Most probably we are in Eden still. It is only our eyes that have changed. </p>			Introduction			2011-04-22T06:12:38-07:00		63				g-k-chesterton	G._K._Chesterton	Chesterton, G. K.	G.

critical thinking, humanism, written word	David Christian	This Fleeting World: A Short History of Humanity	3	Book		2008	1933782048	Symbolic Language	<p> At the moment, the most powerful marker, the feature that distinguishes our species most decisively from closely related species, appears to be symbolic language. Many animals can communicate with each other and share information in rudimentary ways. But humans are the only creatures who can communicate using symbolic language: a system of arbitrary symbols that can be linked by formal grammars to create a nearly limitless variety of precise utterances. Symbolic language greatly enhanced the precision of human communication and the range of ideas that humans can exchange. Symbolic language allowed people for the first time to talk about entities that were not immediately present (including experiences and events in the past and future) as well as entities whose existence was not certain (such as souls, demons, and dreams). </p>						2014-04-09T18:54:37-07:00		288	Berkshire Publishing Group			david-christian	David_Christian	Christian, David	David <strong>Christian</strong>	<a href='../tags/critical-thinking.html' rel='tag'>critical thinking</a>, <a href='../tags/humanism.html' rel='tag'>humanism</a>, <a href='../tags/written-word.html' rel='tag'>written word</a>	<a href='../wisdom/tags/critical-thinking.html' rel='tag'>critical thinking</a>, <a href='../wisdom/tags/humanism.html' rel='tag'>humanism</a>, <a href='../wisdom/tags/written-word.html' rel='tag'>written word</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>This Fleeting World: A Short History of Humanity</cite>, <span class='publisher'>Berkshire Publishing Group</span>, <span class='datepublished'>2008</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1933782048/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>1933782048</a>

And yet, that primitive religions are based entirely on fear and the religions of civilized peoples purely on morality is a prejudice against which we must be on our guard.

It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science. Whoever does not know it and can no longer wonder, no longer marvel, is as good as dead, and his eyes are dimmed. It was the experience of mystery &#8212; even if mixed with fear &#8212; that engendered religion. A knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate, our perceptions of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty, which only in their most primitive forms are accessible to our minds: it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute true religiosity. In this sense, and only this sense, I am a deeply religious man. </p>						2012-11-06T04:07:51-08:00		268				albert-einstein	Albert_Einstein	Einstein, Albert	Albert <strong>Einstein</strong>	<a href='../tags/art.html' rel='tag'>art</a>, <a href='../tags/religion.html' rel='tag'>religion</a>, <a href='../tags/science.html' rel='tag'>science</a>, <a href='../tags/wonder.html' rel='tag'>wonder</a>	<a href='../wisdom/tags/art.html' rel='tag'>art</a>, <a href='../wisdom/tags/religion.html' rel='tag'>religion</a>, <a href='../wisdom/tags/science.html' rel='tag'>science</a>, <a href='../wisdom/tags/wonder.html' rel='tag'>wonder</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>The World As I See It</cite>, <span class='datepublished'>1949</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1599868245/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>1599868245</a>

Buddhism, as we have learned especially from the wonderful writings of Schopenhauer, contains a much stronger element of this. The religious geniuses of all ages have been distinguished by this kind of religious feeling, which knows no dogma and no God conceived in man's image; so that there can be no church whose central teachings are based on it. Hence it is precisely among the heretics of every age that we find men who were filled with this highest kind of religious feeling and were in many cases regarded by their contemporaries as atheists, sometimes also as saints. </p>						2010-08-13T18:22:37-07:00		86				albert-einstein	Albert_Einstein	Einstein, Albert	Albert <strong>Einstein</strong>	<a href='../tags/cultural-evolution.html' rel='tag'>cultural evolution</a>, <a href='../tags/religion.html' rel='tag'>religion</a>, <a href='../tags/wonder.html' rel='tag'>wonder</a>	<a href='../wisdom/tags/cultural-evolution.html' rel='tag'>cultural evolution</a>, <a href='../wisdom/tags/religion.html' rel='tag'>religion</a>, <a href='../wisdom/tags/wonder.html' rel='tag'>wonder</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>Religion and Science</cite>, <span class='datepublished'>1930</span>

While human evolution was crawling at its usual snail's pace, the human imagination was building astounding networks of mass cooperation, unlike any other ever seen on earth. </p>						2016-11-21T09:31:09-08:00		353				yuval-noah-harari	Yuval_Noah_Harari	Harari, Yuval Noah	Yuval Noah <strong>Harari</strong>	<a href='../tags/cultural-evolution.html' rel='tag'>cultural evolution</a>, <a href='../tags/stories.html' rel='tag'>stories</a>	<a href='../wisdom/tags/cultural-evolution.html' rel='tag'>cultural evolution</a>, <a href='../wisdom/tags/stories.html' rel='tag'>stories</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</cite>, <span class='datepublished'>2015</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0062316095/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>0062316095</a> 	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>2015</span>

cultural evolution	Yuval Noah Harari	unknown	3	unknown				These principles have no objective validity	<p> The two texts present us with an obvious dilemma. Both the Code of Hammurabi and the American Declaration of Independence claim to outline universal and eternal principles of justice, but according to the Americans all people are equal, whereas according to the Babylonians people are decidedly unequal. The Americans would, of course, say that they are right, and that Hammurabi is wrong. Hammurabi, naturally, would retort that he is right, and that the Americans are wrong. In fact, they are both Wrong. Hammurabi and the American Founding Fathers alike imagined a reality governed by universal and immutable principles of justice, such as equality or hierarchy. Yet the only place where such universal principles exist is in the fertile imagination of Sapiens, and in the myths they invent and tell one another. These principles have no objective validity. </p>						2016-11-12T13:22:46-08:00		350				yuval-noah-harari	Yuval_Noah_Harari	Harari, Yuval Noah	Yuval Noah <strong>Harari</strong>	<a href='../tags/cultural-evolution.html' rel='tag'>cultural evolution</a>	<a href='../wisdom/tags/cultural-evolution.html' rel='tag'>cultural evolution</a>

Too often we hold fast to the clichés of our forebears. We subject all facts to a prefabricated set of interpretations. We enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought. </p>		http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/Archives/Reference+Desk/Speeches/JFK/003POF03Yale06111962.htm		http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/Archives/Reference+Desk/Speeches/JFK/003POF03Yale06111962.htm		2006-11-30T14:29:31-08:00		129				john-f-kennedy	John_F._Kennedy	Kennedy, John F.

wonder	Jack Kerouac	The Portable Jack Kerouac	3	Letter				The Golden Eternity	<p> I have lots of things to teach you now, in case we ever meet, concerning the message that was transmitted to me under a pine tree in North Carolina on a cold winter moonlit night. It said that Nothing Ever Happened, so don't worry. It's all like a dream. Everything is ecstasy, inside. We just don't know it because of our thinking-minds. But in our true blissful essence of mind is known that everything is alright forever and forever and forever. Close your eyes, let your hands and nerve-ends drop, stop breathing for 3 seconds, listen to the silence inside the illusion of the world, and you will remember the lesson you forgot, which was taught in immense milky way soft cloud innumerable worlds long ago and not even at all. It is all one vast awakened thing. I call it the golden eternity. It is perfect. </p>						2014-03-23T15:19:09-07:00		287				jack-kerouac	Jack_Kerouac	Kerouac, Jack	Jack <strong>Kerouac</strong>	<a href='../tags/wonder.html' rel='tag'>wonder</a>	<a href='../wisdom/tags/wonder.html' rel='tag'>wonder</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Letter</span> <cite class='majortitle'>The Portable Jack Kerouac</cite>

written word	C. S. Lewis	An Experiment in Criticism	3	Book		1961		The Enormous Extension of our Being	<p> Those of us who have been true readers all our life seldom fully realize the enormous extension of our being which we owe to authors. We realize it best when we talk with an unliterary friend. He may be full of goodness and good sense but he inhabits a tiny world. In it, we should be suffocated. The man who is contented to be only himself, and therefore less a self, is in prison. My own eyes are not enough for me, I will see through those of others. Reality, even seen through the eyes of many, is not enough. I will see what others have invented. Even the eyes of all humanity are not enough. I regret that the brutes cannot write books. Very gladly would I learn what face things present to a mouse or a bee; more gladly still would I perceive the olfactory world charged with all the information and emotion it carries for a dog. </p>						2014-12-06T13:20:17-08:00		308				c-s-lewis	C._S._Lewis	Lewis, C.

Because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new.

They were victims of rigorous forms of segregation that routinely and institutionally denied their humanity. So freedom was much more than a word to them. These pioneering musicians were exuberant about exhibiting this newfound personal freedom through their art. But they were also excited about hearing other people do the same thing. They understood that all were inextricably linked in freedom, just as they had been inextricably linked in bondage. And it wasn't theory; it was life as they lived it. </p>	Wynton Marsalis Enterprises					2008-10-20T13:28:13-07:00		151	Random House	New York	162	wynton-marsalis	Wynton_Marsalis	Marsalis, Wynton	Wynton <strong>Marsalis</strong>	<a href='../tags/cultural-evolution.html' rel='tag'>cultural evolution</a>, <a href='../tags/liberty.html' rel='tag'>liberty</a>	<a href='../wisdom/tags/cultural-evolution.html' rel='tag'>cultural evolution</a>, <a href='../wisdom/tags/liberty.html' rel='tag'>liberty</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>Moving to Higher Ground: How Jazz Can Change Your Life</cite>, <span class='city'>New York</span>: <span class='publisher'>Random House</span>, <span class='datepublished'>2008</span>, page&nbsp;<span class='pages'>162</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400060788/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>1400060788</a> 	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>2008</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>Wynton Marsalis Enterprises</span>

In jazz, the bass walks a note on every beat. The drummer rides the cymbal or plays brushes on every beat. And everybody else invents melodies and sounds that sway with, against, and upside every beat. Every beat requires musicians to reassess their relationships to one another. This is what makes swinging so challenging. You are forced to be constantly aware of other people's feelings. </p>	Wynton Marsalis Enterprises					2008-10-07T18:07:48-07:00		154	Random House	New York	40	wynton-marsalis	Wynton_Marsalis	Marsalis, Wynton	Wynton <strong>Marsalis</strong>	<a href='../tags/connection.html' rel='tag'>connection</a>, <a href='../tags/liberty.html' rel='tag'>liberty</a>	<a href='../wisdom/tags/connection.html' rel='tag'>connection</a>, <a href='../wisdom/tags/liberty.html' rel='tag'>liberty</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>Moving to Higher Ground: How Jazz Can Change Your Life</cite>, <span class='city'>New York</span>: <span class='publisher'>Random House</span>, <span class='datepublished'>2008</span>, page&nbsp;<span class='pages'>40</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400060788/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>1400060788</a> 	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>2008</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>Wynton Marsalis Enterprises</span>

In this technological era we can easily be fooled into believing that sophisticated machines are more important than progressive humanity. That's why art is an important barometer of identity. The arts let us know who we are in all of our glory, reveal the best of who we are. All the political and financial might in the world is diminished when put to the service of an impoverished cultural agenda. We see it in our schools, in our homes, and in our world profile: rich and fat, lazy and morally corrupt, with wild, out-of-control young people. </p> <p> We all know that civilization requires a supreme effort.

critical thinking, written word	George Orwell	Politics and the English Language	3	Essay				Politics and the Debasement of Language	<p> A scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he writes, will ask himself at least four questions, thus: What am I trying to say? What words will express it? What image or idiom will make it clearer? Is this image fresh enough to have an effect? And he will probably ask himself two more: Could I put it more shortly? Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly? But you are not obliged to go to all this trouble. You can shirk it by simply throwing your mind open and letting the ready-made phrases come crowding in. They will construct your sentences for you &#8212; even think your thoughts for you, to a certain extent &#8212; and at need they will perform the important service of partially concealing your meaning even from yourself. It is at this point that the special connection between politics and the debasement of language becomes clear. </p>						2014-07-21T18:10:29-07:00		301				george-orwell	George_Orwell	Orwell, George	George <strong>Orwell</strong>	<a href='../tags/critical-thinking.html' rel='tag'>critical thinking</a>, <a href='../tags/written-word.html' rel='tag'>written word</a>	<a href='../wisdom/tags/critical-thinking.html' rel='tag'>critical thinking</a>, <a href='../wisdom/tags/written-word.html' rel='tag'>written word</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Essay</span> <cite class='majortitle'>Politics and the English Language</cite>

equality, value creation	Thomas Piketty	Capital in the Twenty-First Century	3	Book	Copyright	2014	067443000X	A Progressive Annual Tax on Capital	<p> The right solution is a progressive annual tax on capital. This will make it possible to avoid an endless inegalitarian spiral while preserving competition and incentives for new instances of primitive accumulation.... This would contain the unlimited growth of global inequality of wealth, which is currently increasing at a rate that cannot be sustained in the long run and that ought to worry even the most fervent champions of the self-regulated market. Historical experience shows, moreover, that such immense inequalities of wealth have little to do with the entrepreneurial spirit and are of no use in promoting growth.

When you meet with opposition, even if it should be from your husband or your children, endeavour to overcome it by argument and not by authority, for a victory dependent upon authority is unreal and illusory. </p> <p> 5. Have no respect for the authority of others, for there are always contrary authorities to be found. </p> <p> 6. Do not use power to suppress opinions you think pernicious, for if you do the opinions will suppress you. </p> <p> 7. Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric. </p> <p> 8. Find more pleasure in intelligent dissent that in passive agreement, for, if you value intelligence as you should, the former implies a deeper agreement than the latter. </p> <p> 9. Be scrupulously truthful, even if the truth is inconvenient, for it is more inconvenient when you try to conceal it. </p> <p> 10. Do not feel envious of the happiness of those who live in a fool's paradise, for only a fool will think that it is happiness. </p>						2012-08-03T23:01:54-07:00		264				bertrand-russell	Bertrand_Russell	Russell, Bertrand	Bertrand <strong>Russell</strong>	<a href='../tags/critical-thinking.html' rel='tag'>critical thinking</a>, <a href='../tags/diversity.html' rel='tag'>diversity</a>, <a href='../tags/education.html' rel='tag'>education</a>, <a href='../tags/liberty.html' rel='tag'>liberty</a>	<a href='../wisdom/tags/critical-thinking.html' rel='tag'>critical thinking</a>, <a href='../wisdom/tags/diversity.html' rel='tag'>diversity</a>, <a href='../wisdom/tags/education.html' rel='tag'>education</a>, <a href='../wisdom/tags/liberty.html' rel='tag'>liberty</a>		
critical thinking, religion	Bertrand Russell	Is There A God?	3	Essay		1952		The Celestial Teapot	<p> Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of skeptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatics to prove them. This is, of course, a mistake. If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time. </p>						2007-09-08T10:21:56-07:00		193				bertrand-russell	Bertrand_Russell	Russell, Bertrand	Bertrand <strong>Russell</strong>	<a href='../tags/critical-thinking.html' rel='tag'>critical thinking</a>, <a href='../tags/religion.html' rel='tag'>religion</a>	<a href='../wisdom/tags/critical-thinking.html' rel='tag'>critical thinking</a>, <a href='../wisdom/tags/religion.html' rel='tag'>religion</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Essay</span> <cite class='majortitle'>Is There A God?</cite>, <span class='datepublished'>1952</span>

You are involved in an act of the imagination together, imagining the life you want to live, the kind of country you want to live in, the kind of place you want to leave to your children. What are the things that bring you ecstasy and bliss, what are the things that bring on the darkness, and what can we do together to combat those things?

balance, humanism	Matthew Stewart	The Management Myth: Why the Experts Keep Getting it Wrong	3	Book	Copyright	2009	0393065537	A Work Ethic Gone Mad	<p> The blend of corporate mysticism and transcendental consumerism he [Tom Peters] offers has its roots planted in the pragmatic, optimistic, can-do American work ethic. But, like the Taylorist philosophy from which it springs, it is also a work ethic gone mad. It begins with the idea that work can be meaningful and stretches it to the point where there is no meaning outside work. It becomes a deluded form of optimism, a feverish activity that masks an underlying anxiety about the meaning of life, a form of self-alienation so complete that the self disappears entirely into its consumer preferences and transactions. </p>	Matthew Stewart					2010-02-27T13:29:06-08:00		210	W.

education	Matthew Stewart	The Management Myth: Why the Experts Keep Getting it Wrong	3	Book	Copyright	2009	0393065537	Preparing Managers to Manage	<p> The time has come to recognize that higher education in management rests on a fatal fallacy. The idea behind the contemporary business school is that preparing future business managers means training them in a discipline called Business Management. After 100 years of fruitless attempts to produce such a discipline, it should be clear that it does not exist. Preparing managers to manage, in fact, is not different from preparing people to live in a civilized world. Managers do not need to be trained; they need to be <em>educated.</em> And for that purpose, although a certain amount of study of business-related subjects may prove useful, the business schools as they are presently constituted are at best superfluous. </p>	Matthew Stewart					2010-02-27T13:07:00-08:00		212	W.

cultural evolution	Ken Wilber	the integral vision	3	Book	Copyright	2007	1590304756	Levels of Development	<p> To grasp what is involved with levels or stages, let's use a very simple model possessing only 3 of them. If we look at moral development, for example, we find that an infant at birth has not yet been socialized into the culture's ethics and conventions: this is called the <strong>preconventional stage</strong>. It is also called <strong>egocentric</strong>, in that the infant's awareness is largely self-absorbed. But as the young child begins to learns its culture's rules and norms, it grows into the <strong>conventional stage</strong> of morals. This stage is also called <strong>ethnocentric</strong>, in that it centers on the child's particular group, tribe, clan, or nation, and it therefore tends to exclude those not of its group. But at the next major stage of moral development, the <strong>postconventional stage</strong>, the individual's identity expands once again, this time to include a care and concern for all peoples, regardless of race, color, sex or creed, which is why this stage is also called <strong>worldcentric</strong>. </p> <p> Thus, moral development tends to move from &#8216;me&#8217; (egocentric) to &#8216;us&#8217; (ethnocentric) to &#8216;all of us&#8217; (worldcentric)&#8212;a good example of the unfolding waves of consciousness. </p>	Ken Wilber					2008-10-19T09:28:50-07:00		228	Shambhala	Boston &amp; London	34	ken-wilber	Ken_Wilber	Wilber, Ken	Ken <strong>Wilber</strong>	<a href='../tags/cultural-evolution.html' rel='tag'>cultural evolution</a>	<a href='../wisdom/tags/cultural-evolution.html' rel='tag'>cultural evolution</a>	the <span class='sourcetype'>Book</span> <cite class='majortitle'>the integral vision</cite>, <span class='city'>Boston &amp;amp; London</span>: <span class='publisher'>Shambhala</span>, <span class='datepublished'>2007</span>, page&nbsp;<span class='pages'>34</span>, ISBN&nbsp;<a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590304756/portablewisdo-20' class='isbn'>1590304756</a> 	<span class='rights'>Copyright</span> &copy; <span class='datepublished'>2007</span> by <span class='rightsowner'>Ken Wilber</span>

sustainability	E. O. Wilson	Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge	3	Book		1998	0679450777	A Planet-Sized Problem	<p> Few will doubt that humankind has created a planet-sized problem for itself. No one wished it so, but we are the first species to become a geophysical force, altering Earth's climate, a role previously reserved for tectonics, sun flares, and glacial cycles. We are also the greatest destroyer of life since the ten-kilometer-wide meteorite that landed near Yucatan and ended the Age of Reptiles sixty-five million years ago. Through overpopulation we have put ourselves in danger of running out of food and water. So a very Faustian choice is upon us: whether to accept our corrosive and risky behavior as the unavoidable price of population and economic growth, or to take stock of ourselves and search for a new environmental ethic. </p>						2010-10-26T20:07:27-07:00		230	Alfred A.

individuals, religion, society	E. O. Wilson	Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge	3	Book		1998	0679450777	True Character	<p> True character arises from a deeper well than religion. It is the internalization of moral principles of a society, augmented by those tenets personally chosen by the individual, strong enough to endure through trials of solitude and adversity. The principles are fitted together into what we call integrity, literally the integrated self, wherein personal decisions feel good and true. Character is in turn the enduring source of virtue. It stands by itself and excites admiration in others. It is not obedience to authority, and while it is often consistent with and reinforced by religious belief, it is not piety. </p>						2010-10-26T20:00:28-07:00		234	Alfred A.
