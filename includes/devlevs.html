<p>The following summary is largely based on the work of Ken Wilber, Clare W. Graves, Don Beck and Chris Cowan.</p>

<p>Both individuals and societies can be thought of as developing through a series of levels. Higher levels of development supplement lower levels, but do not replace them. Development cannot skip a level, but can be arrested at any stage: progression entirely through the series is in no way assured.</p>

		<td><p>Focused solely on immediate survival needs; minimal sense of self; behavior based on natural instincts and reflexes; concern only for physical self and physical environment; nothing that we would recognize as society or culture.</p>
</td>
		<td><p>This earliest and most primitive level is really characterized by the lack of any social structure, but it’s important to include it, because we are all still motivated by basic survival instincts: fight or flight, hunger, thirst, avoidance of physical danger, and so on. Some social structures can override these basic instincts &ndash; as when a soldier goes to war to protect his or her country &ndash; but these basic survival motivations are all still present, and so must be kept in mind and accounted for.</p>

		<td><p>Beginning to differentiate self from world, and elements of world from one another, and to intuit causal relationships, but no accurate understanding of these relationships; impulsive, possessing faith in magic and superheroes; tribal kinship bonds, ethnic tribes, ancestral stories, superstitious beliefs.</p>
</td>
		<td><p>These are the kinship bonds between husband and wife, parent and child, child and sibling, as well as the bonds linking those who share a particular ethnic heritage tied to a particular region.  The family structure serves to conserve knowledge and property by sharing them among family/tribal members, and passing these things down from one generation to another.</p>

		<td><p>Egocentric; asserting self for dominance, conquest and power; evident in feudal empires and criminal gangs; people organize themselves based on power hierarchies, with the most powerful individuals leading the weaker; might makes right.</p>
</td>
		<td><p>This is a hierarchical structure in which those above have power over those below, and in which the strongest rise towards the apex of the pyramid.  This sort of hierarchical structure is evident in gangs, in corporations, and in organized religions, to point out just a few common usages.</p>

		<td><p>People organize themselves around mythic, fundamentalist principles of truth, with groups requiring close conformity to their particular principles, but with no reliable way to make value judgments comparing one group&rsquo;s &ldquo;truth&rdquo; to another&rsquo;s; group membership based on professed allegiance and obedience to shared principles, rather than on family ties or geography or membership in gangs; fundamental principles held to be absolute and unvarying; belief in the law and in an authoritarian hierarchy from which the law is passed down.</p>
</td>
		<td><p>This is a structure bound together by a shared adherence to a set of written principles, or laws. These writings are accepted as fundamental articles of faith, and are intentionally difficult or impossible to modify.  This social structure can be seen in most religions and in any sort of constitutional government.  Note that such organizations are open to anyone willing to pledge allegiance to the shared principles, without regard for a person’s background or origins.</p>

		<td><p>Society advances based on use of the scientific method; quantitative methods are introduced that allow people to make objective decisions about what is true and what is false; truth is determined based on the testing of a variety of hypotheses, rather than reference to an absolute authority; oriented towards achievement of results.</p>
</td>
		<td><p>These structures are based on networks of peers with common interests, willing to openly share their knowledge with others, and willing to have their beliefs challenged based on fresh data and/or new analysis.  All of science is based on this sort of social structure. Improvements in publishing, such as the printing press, and the World Wide Web, are critical enablers for this sort of structure.</p>

		<td><p>Egalitarian; relativistic; situational; accepting of fluid affiliations; acknowledges that there are multiple, valid ways of perceiving reality, and tries to accept all people and life forms by placing value on diversity; may be seen as a means of accommodating multiple tribes, gangs and mythic orders within a single, overarching social order; consensus-based decision-making.</p>
</td>
		<td><p>This social structure brings together people with many different interests, skills and backgrounds into a shared community in which all have equal status. Diversity is actively valued as a means of improving social cohesion, and as a means of bringing to bear as many different talents as possible. In this structure, individuals are encouraged to explore and discover new and meaningful ways of connecting with one another, essentially creating emergent structure. The World Wide Web is based on this structure.</p>

		<td><p>Sees the importance of the earlier levels, and of the developmental model as a whole; while still acknowledging the value of diversity, also recognizes the validity of healthy value hierarchies.</p>
</td>
		<td><p>A systemic approach consciously and dynamically constructs and modifies social mechanisms with an awareness of all of these various types of structures, with the goal of producing optimal outcomes for society as a whole.  Note that, from an interior perspective, this level encourages an acceptance of all these structures, respecting the strengths of each, without any bias for or against any of them.</p>
