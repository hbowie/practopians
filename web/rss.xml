		<description>&lt;p&gt; The supreme reality of our time is ... the vulnerability of our planet. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; National parks and reserves are an integral aspect of intelligent use of natural resources. It is the course of wisdom to set aside an ample portion of our natural resources as national parks and reserves, thus ensuring that future generations may know the majesty of the earth as we know it today. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

		<description>&lt;p&gt; The Heated debates about &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8217; &amp;#8216;natural way of life&amp;#8217; miss the main point. Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, there hasn&apos;t been a single natural way of life for Sapiens. There are only cultural choices, from among a bewildering palette of possibilities. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

		<description>It may be too early to know who will win on Tuesday, but it&apos;s not too early to assess the major issues roiling the electorate and offer a few thoughts about what needs to happen after the voting is over -- no matter who comes out on top.</description>

		<description>&lt;p&gt; ...language, that magical honeycomb of words into which human reality is forever dissolving and from which it continually reemerges, having invented itself anew. The adjective in the lotus. The jewel in the inkwell. A blue dolphin leaping from a sink of dirty dishes. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

		<title>Having Fewer Children and Grandchildren</title>

		<description>&lt;p&gt; On the subject of climate change, I think we need to not only think of what sort of planet we will be leaving to our children and grandchildren, but start to think about leaving fewer children and grandchildren for our planet to have to sustain. We cannot stop and reverse climate change if the human population of the planet continues to climb; in fact, it is exceedingly improbably that we can save our planet while maintaining the same number of people we have alive today. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

		<title>Only Two Sources of Real Wealth</title>

		<description>&lt;p&gt; We have had to learn the bitter lesson that in all the world there are only two sources of real wealth: the fruit of the earth and the labor of men; and to estimate work not by the money it brings to the producer, but by the worth of the thing that is made. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

		<description>As human society has evolved over the centuries, we have developed different types of social structures. None of the later structures  replace earlier ones, yet each new structure has been devised in order to confer some new sort of evolutionary advantage to our species -- in other words, to help us survive and thrive more effectively.</description>

		<title>Any Love for Justice</title>

		<description>&lt;p&gt; Well, if one really wishes to know how justice is administered in a country, one does not question the policemen, the lawyers, the judges, or the protected members of the middle class. One goes to the unprotected &amp;#8212; those, precisely, who need the law&apos;s protection most! &amp;#8212; and listens to their testimony. Ask any Mexican, any Puerto Rican, any black man, any poor person &amp;#8212; ask the wretched how they fare in the halls of justice, and then you will know, not whether or not the country is just, but whether or not it has any love for justice, or any concept of it. It is certain, in any case, that ignorance, allied with power, is the most ferocious enemy justice can have. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

		<description>&lt;p&gt; If a nation expects to be ignorant and free, in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be. The functionaries of every government have propensities to command at will the liberty and property of their constituents. There is no safe deposit for these but with the people themselves; nor can they be safe with them without information. Where the press is free, and every man able to read, all is safe. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

		<description>&lt;p&gt; When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; That&apos;s a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
