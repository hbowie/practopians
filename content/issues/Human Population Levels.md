Title: Human Population Levels

I believe the most important issue facing humanity today is the size of our population.

Consider:

1. The amounts of land and natural resources available to us on our planet are finite. 
2. Human population levels have grown tremendously over time, and are continuing to grow, enabled by increasingly sophisticated technology and means of economic and social organization.
3. Our goal should be to enable all humans to enjoy a reasonable quality of life -- to give everyone a reasonable chance at the pursuit of happiness. It makes no sense to sacrifice quality of life for sheer quantity of lives.
4. Our planet is already suffering at the hands of humans, through continued depletion of natural resources, extinction of species, and pollution of the environment. In fact, our collective impact on our planet is so great that we are changing its very climate in ways that threaten ourselves, as well as other species. 
5. We must consider cumulative impacts on non-renewable natural resources and our environment, not just current ones. As our population levels continue to grow, we are increasing the current rates at which we deplete and pollute at the very time when the cumulative effects of our past human activities are increasingly making themselves felt. 
6. Even as we make modest strides towards sustainability, resource requirements and environmental impact per capita continue to grow, as citizens of less developed nations become more industrialized. 
7. While technology, coupled with complex social and economic structures, have allowed our human population levels to soar to current levels, there is no reason to think that these same factors can save us from a degraded quality of life as we continue to exhaust our natural resources, kill off other species, and pollute our environment. 
8. In fact, we are increasingly finding that the technologies that have allowed our populations to grow to current levels are already generating undesirable side effects that are inhibiting the growth of the average quality of life for all.
9. If we simply consider the cost of real estate in the most desirable parts of our planet as a proxy, we can readily see that fewer and fewer can afford less and less in these areas, and an ever larger percentage of our population is being crowded out of these areas. And I'm not speaking here of particular neighborhoods, but entire cities. And those relegated to less desirable locations increasingly find it difficult to obtain the essentials of honest employment, clean water, food and housing.  
10. Continued growth in the complexity of our technology, as well as the complexity of our global economy, have made us all more interrelated. We are all dependent on a host of others all across the globe -- unseen and unknowable -- for our sustenance as well as our happiness. Our fates are intertwined in ways we can barely conceive, let alone acknowledge. What affects one affects us all -- not in a vague, spiritual way, but in very concrete and material ways. 

If all of the points above are valid, then they would seem to inexorably lead to the conclusion that we humans acknowledge a moral imperative to have fewer children. 

Here, though, we seem to run up against a number of factors that cause many of us to resist acknowledging any such thing. 

1. Most of our major religious texts were written long ago, when human population levels were a tiny fraction of what they are today. As a result, these texts tend to extoll the virtues of large families.
2. All societies obviously need some level of population replenishment in order to remain healthy, and so parenthood is still a role to be encouraged, rewarded and revered.
3. In all of our entire human history, population growth has been associated with economic growth and prosperity, and population declines have been associated with catastrophes such as famine, pestilence or war. And so any suggestions that we might want to intentionally and willfully reduce our population levels is met by a chorus of naysayers predicting doom and gloom as the result of any such foolishness.
