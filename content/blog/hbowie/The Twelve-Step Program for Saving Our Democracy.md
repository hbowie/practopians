1. Make a clear distinction between news and entertainment. 

The purpose of news is to make you better informed about the important issues of our day. Becoming and staying informed on these topics is serious business. If you're spending hours passively letting various "news" media play in the background during the day while you're doing other things, then you're probably fooling yourself about how much actual news you're receiving. 

2. Consider multiple sources and perspectives.  

No matter what your political orientation, you should be listening to news from multiple sources before forming your own opinion about the events of the day. Any single source will be limited and perhaps biased. 

3. Distinguish between news, speculation and opinion. 

All three of these are valid, but they are different, and you need a balanced diet. If all you are hearing consists of speculation and opinion, then you will not have any actual facts to use to make your own judgments. When you are trying to stay up to date on the actual news, look for new information about things that have actually happened.  Much of what gets "reported" on news shows consists of people opinions about various topics, and/or speculation about what might happen in the future. These may be interesting, but they're not news. 

4. Follow the money.

If you have a paid subscription to a news source, then you can probably trust that their primary allegiance is to their readers. The same is true for publicly supported media that rely on financial contributions from their audience. On the other hand, news media that rely strictly on advertising revenues are biased to minimize their investment in actual reporting, and maximize the amount of time that people spend consuming their news.
