Let me tell you a little story:

Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived two very different tribes. 

The politans lived in the large, gleaming cities overlooking the oceans and seas bordering the wide land. 

The mericans lived on the plains, rivers and mountains outside of the cities. 

The politans were spinners of tales, writers of books, publishers of journals, readers and talkers. When they tired of exchanging words with each other, they created machines to converse with, and invented new languages with which to speak to them. Because they traded only in words, they needed very little space in which to work and live, and so more and more of them continued to crowd into these cities by the seas, and the buildings in which they worked and lived grew taller and taller, reaching skywards. Ships came from foreign lands to bring them supplies, and mericans drove trucks across the wide lands to bring them goods to sustain them. 

The mericans were doers of deeds and makers of things. They read from their holy book on Sundays, and from the first book of laws on other days, and saw no need for further writings. They brought rich ores and black energy up from beneath the earth. They harvested plants and trees for food and houses. They built machines that could travel across the land, and fly through the air, and sail across the seas. 

The politans were of many colors, and came from many lands, and engaged in varied practices.
