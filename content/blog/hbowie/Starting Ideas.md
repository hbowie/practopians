On this Web site I wish to propose and develop a Practical Utopian belief system. 

I think of this system of beliefs as a modern, open-source religion, without the god. 

I propose the Practopian belief system as consisting of the following elements. 

## 1. No Hand on the Tiller Other than our Own

## 2. A Global Human Perspective.

## 3. Balance the Books.

As Practical Utopians, we embrace the following societal values.

* Liberty/Autonomy (#autonomy)
* Equality (#equality)
* Fraternity (#fraternity)
* Work
* Honesty/Integrity
* Compassion
* Diversity (#diversity)
* Humility (#humility) -- A recognition of human limitations. 
* Leadership (#leadership) -- We realize that individuals or small groups are often the first to recognize a new truth or new opportunity, and that we require leaders like this to enable our continued development. 
* Governance
* Critical Thinking (#thinking) 
* Possibilities -- (#possibilities)
* Balance -- We believe that opposing considerations and perspectives often need to be balanced, and that a fine sense of judgment is often called for to achieve the most appropriate balance for a given problem. (#balance)
* Humor -- Humor is often a way of acknowledging that the same situation can appear very differently from varying perspectives. 
* Art (#art)

Title:  The Practical Utopian

*The Practical Utopian* is an evolving set of writings describing a particular approach to the human condition. *Practopian* is a convenient contraction, and the published writings are available at [Practopian.org](http://www.practopian.org), while the source materials are available at [github.com/hbowie/practopian](https://github.com/hbowie/practopian).

The core tenets of this philosophy are as follows:

* Our interests are global in scope; that is, while we also recognize the importance of local and national perspectives, we are not interested in simply pushing problems from one part of the globe to another -- we are interested in the condition of the world as a whole. 

* Our interests are long-term; that is, while we also recognize the importance of the here and now, and the importance of short-term results, we are ultimately focused on conditions as we can expect them to evolve into the future, certainly beyond our own life spans. 

* Our perspective is a human one; that is, while we are concerned about the conditions and fates of other species as well, our values are ultimately rooted in a concern for the human condition. 

* We embrace science; we do not see the scientific method, or modern scientific beliefs, as posing any fundamental contradiction to any other elements of our philosophy. 

* We embrace the inner realities of human existence; that is, while we are comfortable taking an external, objective, view of reality, we are also comfortable considering an inner, subjective view of that same reality. 

* We generally favor a systems approach to addressing problems; that is, rather than treat the symptoms, or simply single out the latest players in the drama, ....

* We care about outcomes; what happens matter to us, and we believe that some outcomes are better than others. 

* We believe that our actions, both individually and collectively, can influence those outcomes. 

* In order to advance our interests, we neither place our trust in, nor relinquish our responsibilities to, any non-human agent, whether such an agent be called God, Evolution, or anything else. 

* Although every stage in human development has resulted in some losses, as well as some benefits, and although progress never occurs in a straight line, on the whole we believe that human development throughout our history has resulted in overall forward movement -- progress, if you like -- and that continued progress is desirable, even if the optimal direction and pace of forward movement is a matter of continuing debate. However, we do not believe that continued forward progress -- or even maintenance of our current state of development -- is assured. 

* We believe that our culture is malleable; that is, while our shared beliefs, values and practices provide a framework in which we operate, our culture is also ultimately a human construct that we can shape in order to produce better outcomes for humanity in the future.

While *The Practical Utopian* is currently the sole work of [Herb Bowie](http://www.herbbowie.com), I invite others to participate in the creation and dissemination of these writings, and ultimately hope to further these efforts through the establishment of a non-profit organization, to be called the Society for Practical Utopians. 

If you are interested in subscribing to or participating further in these efforts in any way, then please contact the author at [hbowie@practopian.org](mailto:hbowie@practopian.org).
