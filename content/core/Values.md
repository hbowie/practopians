Title: Values

These are the things we value most.

1. [Balance][]: We believe in striving for balance between competing concerns. Although all of the values on this list are important to us, we have no desire to establish any one of them as fundamentally absolute.

2. [Liberty][]: We believe in allowing adults as much autonomy as practical, so long as they do not infringe on the life and liberty of others, either directly and individually, or indirectly and communally.

3. [Society][]: We believe in the social fabric that binds us together as part of a shared human community, and need to establish institutions of [governance][] for society.

4. [Connection][]: A feeling of caring connection to others is part of what makes us human, and is the central force that makes each one of us part of something larger than our individual selves.

5. The [Rule of Law][rule-of-law]: Every society must establish laws to govern human interaction, to channel human energy along constructive paths, and to promote useful order; and it is the duty of citizens of a society to obey these laws.

6. [Equality][]: All citizens must be treated equally before the law, without discrimination based on appearance, gender, ethnic origin, race or sexual preference.

7. [Democracy][]: All citizens should have an equal say in defining their society's laws, and equal ability to influence the operation of society's institutions of governance.

8. [Parenthood][]: Parents have an obligation to help their children become healthy, happy adults who make their own positive contributions to society.

9. [Education][]: It is in the best interests of society to assist in the education of its members.

10. [Private and Public Property][property]: We believe in the private ownership of most property, but also in the public ownership of property that can benefit society at large through shared usage.

11. [Proportional Rewards for Value Creation][value-creation]: It is in the best interests of society to encourage its citizens to engage in activities that will create value for themselves and others and society at large, and to allocate capital so that the greatest amount of it is available for use by those with the strongest likelihood of using it wisely.

12. [Diversity][]:  We believe in the diverse expression of human potential.
