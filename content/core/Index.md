Body:

Our Core Writings spell out who we are and what we're about.

* [Background](background.html)
* [Mission](mission.html)
* [Principles](principles.html)
* [Values](values.html)
* [About the Principles and Values](about-the-principles-and-values.html)
* [The Practopian Pledge](pledge.html)

Our most basic and essential aims and beliefs are contained in our Mission, Principles and Values. For convenience, these have been combined into a single, stand-alone document we call [The Practopian Creed](../creed/practopian-creed.html). There is also an [Abridged Version of the Practopian Creed](../creed/abridged-creed.html) that can be conveniently printed out on a single sheet of 8.5 x 11 inch paper.
