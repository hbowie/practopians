<blockquote>
<p>The Heated debates about <em>Homo sapiens</em>&rsquo; &lsquo;natural way of life&rsquo; miss the main point. Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, there hasn&rsquo;t been a single natural way of life for Sapiens. There are only cultural choices, from among a bewildering palette of possibilities.</p>
