<blockquote>
<p>Nobody thinks clearly, no matter what they pretend. Thinking&rsquo;s a dizzy business, a matter of catching as many of those foggy glimpses as you can and fitting them together the best you can. That&rsquo;s why people hang on so tight to their beliefs and opinions; because, compared to the haphazard way in which they&rsquo;re arrived at, even the goofiest opinion seems wonderfully clear, sane and self-evident. And if you let it get away from you, then you&rsquo;ve got to dive back into that foggy muddle to wrangle yourself out another to take its place.</p>
