<blockquote>
<p>The axis today is not liberal and conservative, the axis is constructive-destructive, and you&rsquo;ve cast your lot with the destructive people. Fox has become an incredibly destructive force in our society. You can be better, and this is going to be your legacy if you&rsquo;re not careful.</p>
