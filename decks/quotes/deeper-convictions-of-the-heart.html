<p class="quote-title">Deeper convictions of the heart</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does he learn anything from writing them [his songs]? Does he work out ideas that way?</p> <p>&ldquo;I think you work out something. I wouldn&rsquo;t call them ideas. I think ideas are what you want to get rid of. I don&rsquo;t really like songs with ideas. They tend to become slogans. They tend to be on the right side of things: ecology or vegetarianism or antiwar. All these are wonderful ideas but I like to work on a song until those slogans, as wonderful as they are and as wholesome as the ideas they promote are, dissolve into deeper convictions of the heart. I never set out to write a didactic song. It&rsquo;s just my experience. All I&rsquo;ve got to put in a song is my own experience.&rdquo;</p>
