<blockquote>
<p>Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn&rsquo;t argue about that; I&rsquo;m right and I&rsquo;ll be proved right. We&rsquo;re more popular than Jesus now; I don&rsquo;t know which will go firstâ€”rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll or Christianity. Jesus was all right but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It&rsquo;s them twisting it that ruins it for me.</p>
