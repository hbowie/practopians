<p class="quote-title">Unbelievable Heroes</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old&rsquo;s life: The <cite>Lord of the Rings</cite> and <cite>Atlas Shrugged</cite>. One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world. The other, of course, involves orcs.</p>
