<blockquote>
<p>And whatever we mean by the word &lsquo;spirit&rsquo; &ndash; let us just say, with Tillich, that it involves for each of us our ultimate concern &ndash; it is in that simple awestruck moment when great art enters you and changes you, that spirit shines in this world just a little more brightly than it did the moment before.</p>
