<p>And your remarks on the text,&quot; Mr. Gott declared, &quot;are merely a muddle.</p> <p>Yes, Gott,&quot; said Mike meekly.</p> <p>You see, Mike, you haven&rsquo;t any <em>brain</em> really.</p> <p>No, of course not,&quot; said Mike.</p> <p>You must just keep to the cackle and write nicely. You write very nicely.</p> <p>Yes,&quot; said Mike, dubiously.</p> <p>Keep off thinking things out, and you&rsquo;ll do well. In fact, you&rsquo;ll go far.</p>
