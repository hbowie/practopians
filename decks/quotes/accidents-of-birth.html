<blockquote>
<p>Today Americans still feel that by and large, every individual is responsible for constructing his or her own fate &ndash; the classic pursuit of happiness &ndash; and there is still much debate in the United States about the extent to which, if at all, an individual&rsquo;s success or failure is also shaped by accidents of birth. Nordic people have long ago moved beyond this debate. To most Nordics it&rsquo;s completely obvious that an accident of birth, like being born into poverty or a neighborhood without a good school, can severely disadvantage an individual and destroy any chances of success, no matter what he or she does.</p>
