<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that!&rdquo; said Alice.</p> <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; the Queen said in a pitying tone. &ldquo;Try again: draw a long breath, and shut your eyes.&rdquo;</p> <p>Alice laughed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use trying,&rdquo; she said &ldquo;one can&rsquo;t believe impossible things.&rdquo;</p> <p>&ldquo;I daresay you haven&rsquo;t had much practice,&rdquo; said the Queen. &ldquo;When I was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I&rsquo;ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
