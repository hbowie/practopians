<blockquote>
<p>To grasp what is involved with levels or stages, let&rsquo;s use a very simple model possessing only 3 of them. If we look at moral development, for example, we find that an infant at birth has not yet been socialized into the culture&rsquo;s ethics and conventions: this is called the <strong>preconventional stage</strong>. It is also called <strong>egocentric</strong>, in that the infant&rsquo;s awareness is largely self-absorbed. But as the young child begins to learns its culture&rsquo;s rules and norms, it grows into the <strong>conventional stage</strong> of morals. This stage is also called <strong>ethnocentric</strong>, in that it centers on the child&rsquo;s particular group, tribe, clan, or nation, and it therefore tends to exclude those not of its group. But at the next major stage of moral development, the <strong>postconventional stage</strong>, the individual&rsquo;s identity expands once again, this time to include a care and concern for all peoples, regardless of race, color, sex or creed, which is why this stage is also called <strong>worldcentric</strong>.</p> <p>Thus, moral development tends to move from &lsquo;me&rsquo; (egocentric) to &lsquo;us&rsquo; (ethnocentric) to &lsquo;all of us&rsquo; (worldcentric)&ndash;a good example of the unfolding waves of consciousness.</p>
