<blockquote>
<p>Researching my latest book, Fourth and Long, I met Dr. Ed Zeiders, the pastor of St. Paul&rsquo;s United Methodist Church in State College. He has seen what a college football team can do for a community in ways others might not.</p> <p>&lsquo;We are desperately needy,&rsquo; he told me. &lsquo;We need a place to stand, and a people to stand with, and a cause to stand for. That is not original with me. That came out of World Methodism. And those three propositions hold the key to healthy and value-oriented living. Our culture is devoid of these things.&rsquo;</p>
