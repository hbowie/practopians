<p class="quote-title">The Underlying Principle of the Problem</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When you start looking at a problem and it seems really simple, you don&rsquo;t really understand the complexity of the problem. Then you get into the problem, and you see that it&rsquo;s really complicated, and you come up with all these convoluted solutions. That&rsquo;s sort of the middle, and that&rsquo;s where most people stop&hellip;. But the really great person will keep on going and find the key, the underlying principle of the problem &ndash; and come up with an elegant, really beautiful solution that works. That&rsquo;s what we wanted to do with Mac.</p>
