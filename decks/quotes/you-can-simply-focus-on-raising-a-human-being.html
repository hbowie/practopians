<blockquote>
<p>Imagine, then, what it&rsquo;s like to be a Nordic parent. You can simply focus on raising a human being, in an age-appropriate way at every stage, without ever once feeling guilty that you&rsquo;re not saving enough money, or not making enough money, to secure them the college education they&rsquo;ll need to avoid ending up in the gutter.</p>
