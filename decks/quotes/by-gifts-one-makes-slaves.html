<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Up in our country we are human!&rsquo; said the hunter. &lsquo;And since we are human we help each other. We don&rsquo;t like to hear anybody say thanks for that. What I get today you may get tomorrow. Up here we say that by gifts one makes slaves and by whips one makes dogs.&rsquo;</p>
