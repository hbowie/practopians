<p class="quote-title">To simply see human beings</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I ask you all today to look around and tell me who you see&hellip;. When you look around, I don&rsquo;t want you to see black, white, Asian, I don&rsquo;t want you to wonder if a person is Democrat or Republican, gay or straight. When you look around, I just want you to simply see human beings &ndash; nothing more, nothing less. And I guarantee you, if you can begin to see people that way, just as human beings, you&rsquo;ll begin to treat them a little differently, you&rsquo;ll begin to understand their points of view.</p>
