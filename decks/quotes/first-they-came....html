<p>First they came for the communists, and I didn&rsquo;t speak out because I wasn&rsquo;t a communist.</p> <p>Then they came for the trade unionists, and I didn&rsquo;t speak out because I wasn&rsquo;t a trade unionist.</p> <p>Then they came for the Jews, and I didn&rsquo;t speak out because I wasn&rsquo;t a Jew.</p> <p>Then they came for me and there was no one left to speak out for me.</p>
