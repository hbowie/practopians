<blockquote>
<p>The vast majority of difficult, important human problems &ndash; both inside and outside organizations &ndash; are not solved by a swift, decisive stroke from someone at the top. What usually matters are careful, thoughtful, small, practical efforts by people working far from the limelight.</p>
