<blockquote>
<p>I consider myself a realist. I have certainly seen my share of the world as it really is and not how I wish it would be. What I&rsquo;ve learned is that it is foolish to view realism and idealism as incompatible or to consider our power and wealth as encumbered by the demands of justice, morality and conscience.</p>
