<blockquote>
<p>I learned a lot of things from failure. When you play 162 games, I don&rsquo;t think any sport emulates life like baseball. You play football once a week or basketball twice. But you start playing baseball, you play every day, day in and day out. And you understand in a hurry that you&rsquo;re going to have bad days and bad nights. You&rsquo;re going to have bad weeks, and you just have to make up your mind that, hey, tomorrow&rsquo;s tomorrow, and you forget about it.</p>
