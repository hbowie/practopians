<blockquote>
<p>He&rsquo;s observed that the smartest people are constantly revising their understanding, reconsidering a problem they thought they&rsquo;d already solved. They&rsquo;re open to new points of view, new information, new ideas, contradictions, and challenges to their own way of thinking.</p> <p>What trait signified someone who was <em>wrong</em> a lot of the time? Someone obsessed with details that only support one point of view. If someone can&rsquo;t climb out of the details, and see the bigger picture from multiple angles, they&rsquo;re often wrong most of the time.</p>
