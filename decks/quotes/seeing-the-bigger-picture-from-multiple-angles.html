<blockquote>
<p>He [Jeff Bezos] said people who were right a lot of the time <em>were people who often changed their minds</em>. He doesn&rsquo;t think consistency of thought is a particularly positive trait. It&rsquo;s perfectly healthy &ndash; encouraged, even &ndash; to have an idea tomorrow that contradicted your idea today.</p> <p>He&rsquo;s observed that the smartest people are constantly revising their understanding, reconsidering a problem they thought they&rsquo;d already solved. They&rsquo;re open to new points of view, new information, new ideas, contradictions, and challenges to their own way of thinking.</p> <p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean you shouldn&rsquo;t have a well formed point of view, but it means you should consider your point of view as temporary.</p> <p>What trait signified someone who was <em>wrong</em> a lot of the time? Someone obsessed with details that only support one point of view. If someone can&rsquo;t climb out of the details, and see the bigger picture from multiple angles, they&rsquo;re often wrong most of the time.</p>
