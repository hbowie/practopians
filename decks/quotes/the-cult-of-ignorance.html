<blockquote>
<p>There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there always has been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that &lsquo;my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.&rsquo;</p>
