<blockquote>
<p>Lawrence Summers complained of &lsquo;the development of stateless elites whose allegiance is to global economic success and their own prosperity rather than the interests of the nation where they are headquartered&rsquo;. By 2016, he was warning that the public&rsquo;s tolerance for expert solutions &lsquo;appears to have been exhausted&rsquo;. He advised a new &lsquo;responsible nationalism&rsquo;, which would &lsquo;begin from the idea that the basic responsibility of government is to maximize the welfare of its citizens, not to pursue some abstract concept of the global good&rsquo;. The global elites, in other words, need to catch up with how most people view the world &ndash; not the other way round.</p>
