<blockquote>
<p>Most needed are those &lsquo;third places&rsquo; which lend a public balance to the increased privatization of home life. Third places are nothing more than informal public gathering places. The phrase &lsquo;third places&rsquo; derives from considering our homes to be the &lsquo;first&rsquo; places in our lives, and our work places the &lsquo;second.&rsquo;</p>
