<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the greatest cognitive barrier we face in making sense of the world is that we have come to view certain realities as part of a &ldquo;natural order&rdquo; that will remain unchallenged. In fact, many &ldquo;fundamental truths&rdquo; that we take for granted are simply the fragile constructs of history and could shift radically in the decade ahead.</p>
