<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But none of us has the right to assess the value of a human existence. All must be held valuable, or none. The death of Christ and the death of Socrates,&rdquo; Fen added dryly, &ldquo;suggest that our judgments are scarcely infallible&hellip; And the evil of Nazism lay precisely in this, that a group of men began to differentiate between the value of their fellow-beings, and to act on their conclusions. It isn&rsquo;t a habit which I, for one, would like to encourage.&rdquo;</p>
