<blockquote>
<p>But I have grave doubts about history&rsquo;s long arc. History is not some self-driving car taking humanity to a pre-set destination. Whichever human is behind the wheel must ensure the others stay in the car. Telling some of the passengers they have no business in the driver&rsquo;s seat because they are clueless about the destination will sooner or later result in a crash. &lsquo;Take back control&rsquo; was the chant of Brexiteers and Trump voters alike. It is the war cry of populist backlashes across the Western world.</p>
