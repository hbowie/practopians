<p class="quote-title">The Half-Finished Heaven</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despondency breaks off its course.<br /> Anguish breaks off its course.<br /> The vulture breaks off its flight.</p> <p>The eager light streams out,<br /> even the ghosts take a draught.</p> <p>And our paintings see daylight,<br /> our red beasts of the ice-age studios.</p> <p>Everything begins to look around.<br /> We walk in the sun in hundreds.</p> <p>Each man is a half-open door<br /> leading to a room for everyone.</p> <p>The endless ground under us.</p> <p>The water is shining among the trees.</p> <p>The lake is a window into the earth.</p>
