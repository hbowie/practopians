<p class="quote-title">Only Two Sources of Real Wealth</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have had to learn the bitter lesson that in all the world there are only two sources of real wealth: the fruit of the earth and the labor of men; and to estimate work not by the money it brings to the producer, but by the worth of the thing that is made.</p>
