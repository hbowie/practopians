<blockquote>
<p>Fen sighed. &ldquo;We are all becoming standardized and normal, Nigel. The divine gift of purely nonsensical speech and action is in atrophy. Would you believe it, a pupil of mine had the impertinence the other day to tick me off for reading him passages regarding the Fimble Fowl and the Quangle-Wangle as an illustration of pure poetic inventiveness; I put him in his place all right.&rdquo; In the semi-darkness his eye became momentarily lambent with remembered satisfaction. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s no eccentricity nowadays &ndash; none at all.&rdquo;</p>
