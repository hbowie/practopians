<blockquote>
<p>I listened in the studio control room as musicians&rsquo; modes of consciousness-alteration proceeded from grass, hash and acid to heroin and cocaine by the 1970s. All but the latter could, on occasion, provide benefits, at least to the music. I never knew cocaine to improve anything&hellip;. I suspect that the surge in cocaine&rsquo;s popularity explains &ndash; at least in part &ndash; why so many great sixties artists made such bad records in the following decade.</p>
