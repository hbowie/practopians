<blockquote>
<p>An integral approach acknowledges that all views have a degree of truth, but some views are more true than others, more evolved, more developed, more adequate. And so let&rsquo;s get that part out of the way right now: homophobia in any form, as far as I can tell, stems from a lower level of human development &ndash; but it is a level, it exists, and one has to make room in one&rsquo;s awareness for those lower levels as well, just as one has to include third grade in any school curriculum. Just don&rsquo;t, you know, put those people in charge of anything important.</p>
