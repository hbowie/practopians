<blockquote>
<p>But the main point is that this Left Hand dimension refers to the inside, to the <em>interior depth</em> that is <em>consciousness</em> itself.</p> <p>Q: You said earlier that depth is consciousness, or what depth looked like from within.</p> <p>KW: Yes, exactly. The Left Hand is what the holon looks like from within; the Right Hand is what the same holon looks like from without. Interior and exterior. Consciousness and form. Subjective and objective.</p>
