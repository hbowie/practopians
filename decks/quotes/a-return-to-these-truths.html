<blockquote>
<p>Our challenges may be new. The instruments with which we meet them may be new. But those values upon which our success depends &ndash; hard work and honesty, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism &ndash; these things are old. These things are true. They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history. What is demanded then is a return to these truths.</p>
