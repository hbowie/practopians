<blockquote>
<p>The supreme reality of our time is &hellip; the vulnerability of our planet.</p> <p>National parks and reserves are an integral aspect of intelligent use of natural resources. It is the course of wisdom to set aside an ample portion of our natural resources as national parks and reserves, thus ensuring that future generations may know the majesty of the earth as we know it today.</p>
