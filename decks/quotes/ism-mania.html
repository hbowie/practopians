<blockquote>
<p>Grandpa: Penny why don&rsquo;t you write a play about ism-mania?</p> <p>Penny: Ism-mania?</p> <p>Grandpa: Yeah, sure, you know &ndash; communism, fascism, voodooism. Everybody&rsquo;s got an ism these days.</p> <p>Penny: I feel like I&rsquo;ve got this itch or something.</p> <p>Grandpa: It&rsquo;s just as catching. When things go a little bad nowadays, you go out and get yourself an ism and you&rsquo;re in business.</p> <p>Penny: I&rsquo;ve got it! It might help Cynthia to have an ism in the monastery!</p> <p>Grandpa: It might at that. Only give her Americanism. Let her know something about Americans: John Paul Jones, Patrick Henry, Samuel Adams, Washington, Jefferson, Monroe, Lincoln, Grant, Lee, Edison, Mark Twain. When things got tough for those boys, they didn&rsquo;t run around looking for isms. Lincoln said, &ldquo;With malice toward none, with charity for all.&rdquo; Nowadays they say, &ldquo;Think the way I do, or I&rsquo;ll bomb the daylights out of you.&rdquo;</p>
