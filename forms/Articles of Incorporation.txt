LIMITATION OF DIRECTOR LIABILITY      To the full extent that the Washington Nonprofit Corporation Act (as it exists on the date hereof or as it may hereafter be amended) permits the limitation or elimination of the liability of Directors, a Director of the corporation shall not be liable to the corporation or its members, if any, for monetary damages for conduct as a Director.

INDEMNIFICATION7.1 Right to Indemnification      The corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, any person who was or is made or is threatened to be made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "Proceeding"), by reason of the fact that such person, or a person for whom such person is the legal representative, is or was a Director or officer of the corporation or, while a Director or officer of the corporation, is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a Director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another corporation, or of a foundation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust, enterprise or other nonprofit entity, including service with respect to employee benefit plans (each such other entity, "Another Enterprise") (such person, an "Indemnified Person"), against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with such Proceeding.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, except as otherwise provided in Section 7.4 of this Article 7, the corporation shall be required to indemnify an Indemnified Person in connection with a Proceeding (or part of such Proceeding) commenced by such Indemnified Person only if the commencement of such Proceeding (or part os such Proceeding) by the Indemnified Person was authorized in advance by the Board of Directors.7.2 Restrictions on Indemnification      The corporation may not indemnify any Indemnified Person for: (a) acts or omissions of the Indemnified Person finally adjudged to be intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; (b) conduct of the Indemnified Person finally adjudged to be in violation of violation of Section 24.03.043 of the Washington Nonprofit Corporation Act in reference to Section 23B.08.310 of the Washington Business Corporation Act; or (c) any transaction with respect to which it was finally adjudged that such Indemnified Person personally received a benefit in money, property or services to which the Indemnified Person was not legally entitled or if the corporation is otherwise prohibited by applicable law from paying such indemnification; provided, however, that if Section 23B.08.560 or any successor provision of the Washington Business Corporation Act is hereafter amended, the restrictions on indemnification set forth in this Section 7.2 shall be as set forth in such amended statutory provision.7.3	Expenses Payable in Advance      The corporation shall pay the reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by an Indemnified Person in defending any Proceeding in advance of such Proceeding's final disposition (such expenses, "Advanced Expenses"), provided, however, that, to the extent required by law, such payment of Advanced Expenses in advance of the final disposition of the Proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the Indemnified Person to repay all Advanced Expenses if it should be ultimately determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article 7 or otherwise.  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing in this Section 7.3, the corporation shall not be required to pay any Advanced Expenses to a person against whom the corporation directly brings a claim alleging that the corporation is not required to indemnify such person under Section 7.2 of this Article 7.7.4	Written Statement Required and Right of Indemnified Person to Bring Suit      An Indemnified Person seeking indemnification pursuant to Section 7.1 or Advanced Expenses pursuant to Section 7.3 must first submit to the Board a sworn statement requesting indemnification or Advanced Expenses, as the case may be, and reasonable evidence of all such amounts requested by such Indemnified Person (such statement, a "Claim").  If (a) a Claim pursuant to Section 7.1 above is not paid in full by the corporation within 60 days after such Claim has been received by the corporation, or (b) a Claim pursuant to Section 7.3 above is not paid in full by the corporation within 30 days after such Claim has been received by the corporation, then the Indemnified Person may at any time after the expiration of the applicable period bring suit against the corporation to recover the unpaid amount of such Claim.  If an Indemnified Person succeeds in whole or in part in any such suit or in a suit brought by the corporation to recover Advanced Expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, then such Indemnified Person is also entitled to receive reimbursement from the corporation for the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit.  The Indemnified Person shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification under this Article 7 upon submission of a Claim (and, in an action brought to enforce a Claim for Advanced Expenses, where the required undertaking has been delivered to the corporation), and, thereafter, the corporation shall have the burden of proof to overcome the presumption that the Indemnified Person is so entitled.7.5	Procedures Exclusive      Pursuant to Section 24.03.043 of the Washington Nonprofit Corporation Act in reference to Section 23B.08.560(2) or any successor provision of the Washington Business Corporation Act, the procedures for indemnification and Advanced Expenses set forth in this Article 7 are in lieu of the procedures required by Section 23B.08.550 or any successor provision of the Washington Business Corporation Act.7.6	Nonexclusivity of Rights      The right to indemnification and Advanced Expenses conferred by this Article 7 shall not be exclusive of any other right that any person may have or hereafter acquire under (a) any statute, (b) provision of these Articles of Incorporation,(c) the Bylaws of the corporation, (d) by general or specific action of the Board of Directors, (e) by contract or (f) otherwise.7.7	Insurance, Contracts and Funding      The corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and any Director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of the corporation or Another Enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the Washington Business Corporation Act.  The corporation may enter into contracts with any Director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent of the corporation in furtherance of the provisions of this Article 7 and may create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means (including, without limitation, a letter of credit) to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to effect indemnification and Advanced Expenses as provided in this Article 7.7.8	Indemnification of Employees and Agents of the Corporation      The corporation may, by action of the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses to employees and agents or any class or group of employees and agents of the corporation (a) with the same scope and effect as the provisions of this Article 7 with respect to the indemnification and Advanced Expenses of Directors and officers of the corporation, (b) pursuant to rights granted under, or provided by, the Washington Business Corporation Act, or (c) as are otherwise consistent with law.7.9	Persons Serving Other Entities      Any person who, while a Director or officer of the corporation, is or was serving (a) as a Director or officer of another foreign or domestic corporation of which a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of its Directors is held by the corporation or (b) as a partner, trustee or otherwise in an executive or management capacity in a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise of which the corporation or a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation is a general partner or has a majority ownership shall be deemed to be (i) so serving at the request of the corporation and (ii) entitled to indemnification and Advanced Expenses under this Section 7.ARTICLE 8.
