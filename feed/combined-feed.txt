Quotes	Quotation	2015-03-18T18:19:43-07:00	I must study politics and war	quotes/i-must-study-politics-and-war.html	cultural evolution, education, parenthood	<p> I must study politics and war, that our sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy. Our sons ought to study mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history and naval architecture, navigation, commerce and agriculture in order to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, music, architecture, statuary, tapestry and porcelain. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2008-05-21T19:25:38-07:00	A Dark Procession	quotes/a-dark-procession.html	critical thinking	<p> Mercer did not think at all in the accepted sense of the word. Ideas occurred to him and engendered other ideas. But the process which linked any two of them was a dark procession taking place in some subconscious part of the brain. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2007-10-24T18:20:11-07:00	Merely Thoroughly Outrageous	quotes/merely-thoroughly-outrageous.html	cultural evolution	<p> He made the discovery with a certain amount of relief, since it took him at least out of the region of pure fantasy and into the merely thoroughly outrageous, with which as a modern he was by now more or less familiar. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2008-05-21T19:41:18-07:00	Occasions When the Intellect Retires Gracefully	quotes/occasions-when-the-intellect-retires-gracefully.html	critical thinking	<p> There are occasions when the intellect retires gracefully from a situation entirely behind its decorous control and leaves all the other complicated machinery of the mind to muddle through on its own. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2008-05-21T19:37:17-07:00	The Only Sign of Mental Activity	quotes/the-only-sign-of-mental-activity.html	written word	<p> The other pictures varied between the sentimentally lewd and the illustrated Scotch joke variety wherein Glengarried dogs take the place of figures. There were no books and a small writing table with drawers was the only sign of mental activity. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2011-08-01T12:36:08-07:00	We don't even own suits	quotes/we-dont-even-own-suits.html	critical thinking, diversity, liberty, systemic	<p> When an AT&amp;T rep suggested Jobs wear a suit to meet with AT&amp;T's CEO, the deputy replied, &#8220;We're Apple. We don't wear suits. We don't even own suits.&#8221; </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2008-10-18T11:12:38-07:00	Model II Decision-Making	quotes/model-ii-decision-making.html	critical thinking, diversity, liberty, society	<p> Model II encourages the individual to maximize his uniqueness. If, in doing so, he should arrive at goals that differ from those developed by others, he will have done so under conditions of openness, trust and risk-taking. The individual would therefore feel free to discuss his differences openly with the group. Moreover, if the individual is in a subordinate power position, and if he feels he had adequate opportunity to dissuade the group and that the group publicly confronted and tested all differences, then the individual will probably be motivated to work toward the group goal but still be motivated to generate new information that may change the group's decision. This means that one can be externally committed to a decision and internally committed to the decision-making processes that produced the decision yet simultaneously monitor the consequences of the decision thoroughly to seek new, valid information to reconfront the decision without being considered disloyal. In the model-II world, conflicts do not disappear&#8212;indeed, the illusion of conflict disappearing is more typical of the model-I world, in which conflicts are settled by power plays based on sanctions, charisma or loyalty. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2008-10-16T20:49:39-07:00	Model II Values	quotes/model-ii-values.html	critical thinking, liberty, society	<p> Clearly, Model II touches on values that are central to social life and to the traditions of moral philosophy: freedom of choice, truth and testability, the nature of commitment, the possibilities for and limitations on openness in communication among individuals, the basis for trust and cooperation among human beings, the sources of long-term personal effectiveness. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2006-11-30T14:29:31-08:00	Entertain a Thought	quotes/entertain-a-thought.html	critical thinking	<p> It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2007-11-06T07:00:58-08:00	The Four-Fold Way	quotes/the-four-fold-way.html	critical thinking, love	<p> The following four principles, each based on an archetype, comprise what I call the Four-Fold Way: </p> <p> 1. <em>Show up, or choose to be present.</em> Being present allows us to access the human resources of power, presence, and communication. This is the way of the Warrior. </p> <p> 2. <em>Pay attention to what has heart and meaning.</em> Paying attention opens us to the human resources of love, gratitude, acknowledgment, and validation. This is the way of the Healer. </p> <p> 3. <em>Tell the truth without blame or judgment.</em> Nonjudgmental truthfulness maintains our authenticity, and develops our inner vision and intuition. This is the way of the Visionary. </p> <p> 4. <em>Be open to outcome, not attached to outcome.</em> Openness and nonattachment help us to recover the human resources of wisdom and objectivity. This is the way of the Teacher. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2014-09-04T03:51:11-07:00	The Cult of Ignorance	quotes/the-cult-of-ignorance.html	critical thinking	<p> There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there always has been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that &#8216;my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.&#8217; </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2006-12-19T16:27:23-08:00	Cockpits with Instruments Controlled by Gremlins	quotes/cockpits-with-instruments-controlled-by-gremlins.html	humanism, liberty, stories	<p> One frequent analogy casts the manager in the role of an airplane pilot guided by organizational measures that are like cockpit instruments. </p> <p> Mechanistic and organic analogies are flawed because they are too simplistic. Kaplan and Norton's cockpit analogy would be more accurate if it included a multitude of tiny gremlins controlling wing flaps, fuel flow, and so on of a plane being buffeted by winds and generally struggling against nature, but with the gremlins always controlling information flow back to the cockpit instruments, for fear that the pilot might find gremlin replacements. It would not be surprising if airplanes guided this way occasionally flew into mountainsides when they seemed to be progressing smoothly toward their destinations. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2014-06-13T04:28:19-07:00	We Need a Place to Stand	quotes/we-need-a-place-to-stand.html	society, written word	<p> Researching my latest book, Fourth and Long, I met Dr. Ed Zeiders, the pastor of St. Paul's United Methodist Church in State College. He has seen what a college football team can do for a community in ways others might not. </p> <p> &#8216;We are desperately needy,&#8217; he told me. &#8216;We need a place to stand, and a people to stand with, and a cause to stand for. That is not original with me. That came out of World Methodism. And those three propositions hold the key to healthy and value-oriented living. Our culture is devoid of these things.&#8217; </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2006-11-30T14:29:31-08:00	Careful, thoughtful, small, practical efforts	quotes/careful-thoughtful-small-practical-efforts.html	individuals, practical	<p> The vast majority of difficult, important human problems &#8212; both inside and outside organizations &#8212; are not solved by a swift, decisive stroke from someone at the top. What usually matters are careful, thoughtful, small, practical efforts by people working far from the limelight. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2015-12-31T10:56:51-08:00	Any Love for Justice	quotes/any-love-for-justice.html	equality, rule of law	<p> Well, if one really wishes to know how justice is administered in a country, one does not question the policemen, the lawyers, the judges, or the protected members of the middle class. One goes to the unprotected &#8212; those, precisely, who need the law's protection most! &#8212; and listens to their testimony. Ask any Mexican, any Puerto Rican, any black man, any poor person &#8212; ask the wretched how they fare in the halls of justice, and then you will know, not whether or not the country is just, but whether or not it has any love for justice, or any concept of it. It is certain, in any case, that ignorance, allied with power, is the most ferocious enemy justice can have. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2006-12-02T12:08:20-08:00	Ancient ethnic sores belching fire	quotes/ancient-ethnic-sores-belching-fire.html	cultural evolution, diversity, systemic	<p> The complications of this diversity can be overwhelming. Ancient ethnic sores are belching fire while transnational companies linked by satellites conduct their business oblivious to the feudal past below. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2011-01-18T04:57:18-08:00	Our Reply to Violence	quotes/our-reply-to-violence.html	art, love	<p> This will be our reply to violence: to make music more intensely, more beautifully, more devotedly than ever before. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2012-10-22T05:30:34-07:00	Seeing the Bigger Picture from Multiple Angles	quotes/seeing-the-bigger-picture-from-multiple-angles.html	critical thinking, diversity, integral	<p> He [Jeff Bezos] said people who were right a lot of the time <em>were people who often changed their minds</em>. He doesn't think consistency of thought is a particularly positive trait. It's perfectly healthy &#8212; encouraged, even &#8212; to have an idea tomorrow that contradicted your idea today. </p> <p> He's observed that the smartest people are constantly revising their understanding, reconsidering a problem they thought they'd already solved. They're open to new points of view, new information, new ideas, contradictions, and challenges to their own way of thinking. </p> <p> This doesn't mean you shouldn't have a well formed point of view, but it means you should consider your point of view as temporary. </p> <p> What trait signified someone who was <em>wrong</em> a lot of the time? Someone obsessed with details that only support one point of view. If someone can't climb out of the details, and see the bigger picture from multiple angles, they're often wrong most of the time. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2007-02-28T05:26:45-08:00	Art, Science and Empire	quotes/art-science-and-empire.html	art, science	<p> The foundation of empire is art and science. Remove them or degrade them, and the empire is no more. Empire follows art and not vice versa as Englishmen suppose. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2007-02-28T05:24:29-08:00	Expectations of holiness	quotes/expectations-of-holiness.html	imperfection	<p> It is not because angels are holier than men or devils that makes them angels, but because they do not expect holiness from one another, but from God only. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2007-02-28T05:22:20-08:00	Minute Particulars	quotes/minute-particulars.html	practical	<p> He who would do good to another must do it in Minute Particulars: general Good is the plea of the scoundrel, hypocrite, and flatterer, for Art and Science cannot exist but in minutely organized Particulars. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2007-02-28T05:28:16-08:00	To see a world in a grain of sand	quotes/to-see-a-world-in-a-grain-of-sand.html	art, love	<p> To see a world in a grain of sand <br /> And heaven in a wild flower <br /> Hold infinity in the palm of your hand <br /> And eternity in an hour. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2006-11-30T14:29:31-08:00	Cost of Education	quotes/cost-of-education.html	critical thinking, education	<p> If you think education is expensive, try ignorance. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2016-09-17T09:01:00-07:00	Having Fewer Children and Grandchildren	quotes/having-fewer-children-and-grandchildren.html	population	<p> On the subject of climate change, I think we need to not only think of what sort of planet we will be leaving to our children and grandchildren, but start to think about leaving fewer children and grandchildren for our planet to have to sustain. We cannot stop and reverse climate change if the human population of the planet continues to climb; in fact, it is exceedingly improbably that we can save our planet while maintaining the same number of people we have alive today. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2010-11-20T12:35:29-08:00	The Tautness of this Resonant Connection	quotes/the-tautness-of-this-resonant-connection.html	art	<p> No matter what the form, all art seems to produce a similar sensation &#8212; of timelessness, of implicit order, of connectedness. It is as if the work of art had sounded some deep note, and caused sympathetic vibration in a hidden string, a string whose one end is secured in the human heart, and from there ascends towards some unknowable summit, the existence of the termination point affirmed only by the tautness of this resonant connection. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2008-11-02T06:54:53-08:00	Chaos and Mediocrity	quotes/chaos-and-mediocrity.html	cultural evolution, society	<p> Is this one legacy of the sixties? That after flinging open the doors to a world previously known only at the margins of society, the pioneers would move on, leaving the masses to add drugs to the myriad forces pulling our society towards chaos and mediocrity? </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2008-11-02T08:45:15-08:00	Counter-Culture's own values and aesthetics decayed	quotes/counter-cultures-own-values-and-aesthetics-decayed.html	cultural evolution	<p> Beneath the surface, the progressive sixties hid all manner of unpleasantness: sexism, reaction, racism and factionalism. It wasn't surprising, really. The idea that drugs, sex and music could transform the world was always a pretty naïve dream. As the counter-culture's effect on the mainstream grew, its own values and aesthetics decayed. The political setbacks of the coming years grabbed the headlines while the dilution of ideals happened more quietly, but nonetheless vividly for those who noticed. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2008-11-02T07:13:25-08:00	History as Postmodern Collage	quotes/history-as-postmodern-collage.html	art	<p> Sitting in Princeteon listening to old records, we became obsessed with the past. We tried to pierce the veil of time and grasp what it sounded, felt, looked and smelled like. In Harvard Square and London I met many with similar preoccupations; they didn't seem unusual at all. When old blues singers began to reappear, it delivered a rush of excitement and adrenalin. Meeting and traveling with Gary Davis and Lonnie Johnson &#8212; even Coleman Hawkins &#8212; armoured me against a host of disappointments. </p> <p> History today seems more like a postmodern collage; we are surrounded by two-dimensional representations of our heritage. Access via Amazon.com or iPod to all those boxed sets of old blues singers &#8212; or Nick Drake, for that matter &#8212; doesn't equate with the sense of discovery and connection we experienced. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2008-11-02T09:33:08-08:00	Little I recognized as music	quotes/little-i-recognized-as-music.html	art	<p> Thirty years after Brighton, I walked sadly away from the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Fair. It was everything my twenty-one-year-old self might have dreamed of: 75,000 people packed into the Fairgrounds, with NPR-subscriber bags holding expertly marked programmes. America's black musical heritage was on parade across two long weekends and eight stages. But the audience was almost entirely white. The performers had learned their lessons, dropping any modernizations or slick showbiz gestures and recreating the old-time styles the sophisticated audiences craved. On one level, it demonstrated respect for a deep culture and a rejection of shallow novelty. But removed from the soil in which it grew the music felt lifeless, like actors portraying characters who happened to be their younger selves. In two days wandering from stage to stage, I heard little I recognized as music. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2008-11-02T07:21:09-08:00	Never Knew Cocaine to Improve Anything	quotes/never-knew-cocaine-to-improve-anything.html	art, cultural evolution	<p> I listened in the studio control room as musicians&#8217; modes of consciousness-alteration proceeded from grass, hash and acid to heroin and cocaine by the 1970s. All but the latter could, on occasion, provide benefits, at least to the music. I never knew cocaine to improve anything.... I suspect that the surge in cocaine's popularity explains &#8212; at least in part &#8212; why so many great sixties artists made such bad records in the following decade. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2008-11-02T08:12:54-08:00	Records we made together in the sixties	quotes/records-we-made-together-in-the-sixties.html	art, connection	<p> These days most engineers confronted with a displeasing sound reach for the knobs on the console and tweak the high, mid or low frequencies. When that process is inflicted on more and more tracks of a multi-channel recording the sound passes through dozens of transistors, resulting in a narrower, more confined sound. With the added limitations of digital sound, you end up with a bright and shiny, thin and two-dimensional recording. To my ears anyway. </p> <p> When John [Wood] heard a sound he didn't like, he would lift his bulky frame off the chair and lumber down the stairs, muttering all the way. I began to be able to predict whether he was going to try a different microphone, reposition the existing one or shift the offending musician to another part of the studio. When I listen to records we made together in the sixties, I can still hear the air in the studio and the full dimension of the sounds the musicians created for us. I can hear the depth of Nick Drake's breath as well as his voice, the grit in the crude strings of Robin Williamson's <cite>gimbri</cite> and Dave Mattacks&#8217; drum technique spread out warmly in aural Technicolor across the stereo spectrum. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2008-11-02T07:28:14-08:00	Sixties Surpluses of Money and Time	quotes/sixties-surpluses-of-money-and-time.html	cultural evolution	<p> The atmosphere in which music flourished then had a lot to do with economics. It was a time of unprecedented prosperity. People are supposedly wealthier now, yet most feel they haven't enough money and time is at an even greater premium.... In the sixties, we had surpluses of both money and time. </p> <p> Friends of mine lived comfortably in Greenwich Village, Harvard Square, Bayswater, Santa Monica and on the Left Bank and were, by current standards, broke. Yet they survived easily on occasional coffee-house gigs or part-time work. Today, urbanites must feverishly maximize their economic potential just to maintain a small flat in Hoboken, Somerville, Hackney, Korea Town or Belleville. The economy of the sixties cut us a lot of slack, leaving time to travel, take drugs, write songs and rethink the universe. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2015-03-21T11:15:56-07:00	People ask me to predict the future	quotes/people-ask-me-to-predict-the-future.html	individuals, progress	<p> People ask me to predict the future, when all I want to do is prevent it. Better yet, build it. Predicting the future is much too easy, anyway. You look at the people around you, the street you stand on, the visible air you breathe, and predict more of the same. To hell with more. I want better. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2006-11-30T14:29:31-08:00	Art is a Hammer	quotes/art-is-a-hammer.html	art, individuals	<p> Art is not a mirror held up to reality, but a hammer with which to shape it. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2006-11-30T14:29:32-08:00	Nirvana Antipattern	quotes/nirvana-antipattern.html	critical thinking	<p> The typical, and primary, root cause of [the Nirvana] AntiPattern is the misguided notion that conflict is bad, and therefore should be avoided at all costs. In reality, conflict in the form of tension ... is a necessary part of any difficult task that involves intelligent people who care about their work. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2010-01-22T15:22:21-08:00	Two ideas of government	quotes/two-ideas-of-government.html	equality, governance	<p> There are two ideas of government. There are those who believe that you just legislate to make the well-to-do prosperous, that their prosperity will leak through on those below. The Democratic idea has been that if you legislate to make the masses prosperous, their prosperity will find its way up and through every class that rests upon it. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2011-07-11T05:05:21-07:00	Between Saturday night and Sunday morning	quotes/between-saturday-night-and-sunday-morning.html	imperfection	<p> Oh, there's a thin line between Saturday night and Sunday morning. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2008-08-05T16:02:04-07:00	An Invincible Summer	quotes/an-invincible-summer.html	humanism	<p> In the depths of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2008-01-25T08:18:43-08:00	Work, Soul and Life	quotes/work-soul-and-life.html	value creation	<p> Without work, all life goes rotten. But when work is soulless, life stifles and dies. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2010-11-21T07:23:15-08:00	Six Impossible Things Before Breakfast	quotes/six-impossible-things-before-breakfast.html	critical thinking	<p> &#8220;I can't believe that!&#8221; said Alice. </p> <p> &#8220;Can't you?&#8221; the Queen said in a pitying tone. &#8220;Try again: draw a long breath, and shut your eyes.&#8221; </p> <p> Alice laughed. &#8220;There's no use trying,&#8221; she said &#8220;one can't believe impossible things.&#8221; </p> <p> &#8220;I daresay you haven't had much practice,&#8221; said the Queen. &#8220;When I was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.&#8221; </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2010-03-10T06:39:13-08:00	A mind is blown	quotes/a-mind-is-blown.html	wonder	<p> A mind is blown when something you always feared but knew to be impossible turns out to be true; when the world turns out far vaster, far more marvelous or malevolent than you ever dreamed; when you get proof that everything is connected to everything else, that everything you know is wrong, that you are both the center of the universe and a tiny speck sailing off its nethermost edge. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2006-11-30T14:29:32-08:00	Down These Mean Streets	quotes/down-these-mean-streets.html	individuals	<p> Down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid. If there were enough like him, I think the world would be a very safe place to live in, and yet not too dull to be worth living in. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2006-11-30T14:29:32-08:00	Vital and Significant Forms of Art	quotes/vital-and-significant-forms-of-art.html	art, individuals	<p> Nor is it any part of my thesis to maintain that it [the detective story] is a vital and significant form of art. There are no vital and significant forms of art; there is only art, and precious little of that. The growth of populations has in no way increased the amount; it has merely increased the adeptness with which substitutes can be produced and packaged. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2011-04-22T06:06:37-07:00	Conservatives and Progressives	quotes/conservatives-and-progressives.html	governance, progress	<p> The whole modern world has divided itself into Conservatives and Progressives. The business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of Conservatives is to prevent mistakes from being corrected. Even when the revolutionist might himself repent of his revolution, the traditionalist is already defending it as part of his tradition. Thus we have two great types &#8212; the advanced person who rushes us into ruin, and the retrospective person who admires the ruins. He admires them especially by moonlight, not to say moonshine. Each new blunder of the progressive or prig becomes instantly a legend of immemorial antiquity for the snob. This is called the balance, or mutual check, in our Constitution. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2011-04-22T06:09:00-07:00	Generosity Among the Rich	quotes/generosity-among-the-rich.html	connection	<p> Among the rich you will never find a really generous man even by accident. They may give their money away, but they will never give themselves away; they are egotistic, secretive, dry as old bones. To be smart enough to get all that money you must be dull enough to want it. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2011-04-22T06:04:28-07:00	Mysticism has kept men sane	quotes/mysticism-has-kept-men-sane.html	wonder	<p> The truth is that Tolstoy, with his immense genius, with his colossal faith, with his vast fearlessness and vast knowledge of life, is deficient in one faculty and one faculty alone. He is not a mystic; and therefore he has a tendency to go mad. Men talk of the extravagances and frenzies that have been produced by mysticism; they are a mere drop in the bucket. In the main, and from the beginning of time, mysticism has kept men sane. The thing that has driven them mad was logic. ...The only thing that has kept the race of men from the mad extremes of the convent and the pirate-galley, the night-club and the lethal chamber, has been mysticism&#8212; the belief that logic is misleading, and that things are not what they seem. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2011-04-22T06:14:33-07:00	Taking a Fence Down	quotes/taking-a-fence-down.html	critical thinking, governance, progress	<p> In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away. To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2011-04-22T06:11:48-07:00	The cause which is blocking all progress	quotes/the-cause-which-is-blocking-all-progress.html	love, progress	<p> The cause which is blocking all progress today is the subtle scepticism which whispers in a million ears that things are not good enough to be worth improving. If the world is good we are revolutionaries, if the world is evil we must be conservatives. These essays, futile as they are considered as serious literature, are yet ethically sincere, since they seek to remind men that things must be loved first and improved afterwards. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2011-04-22T06:05:01-07:00	The center of every man's existence is a dream	quotes/the-center-of-every-mans-existence-is-a-dream.html	humanism	<p> The center of every man's existence is a dream. Death, disease, insanity, are merely material accidents, like a toothache or a twisted ankle. That these brutal forces always besiege and often capture the citadel does not prove that they are the citadel. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2011-04-22T06:08:09-07:00	The difference between construction and creation	quotes/the-difference-between-construction-and-creation.html	love	<p> The whole difference between construction and creation is exactly this: that a thing constructed can only be loved after it is constructed; but a thing created is loved before it exists, as the mother can love the unborn child. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2011-04-22T06:03:10-07:00	This dazed and dramatic ignorance	quotes/this-dazed-and-dramatic-ignorance.html	wonder	<p> One of the deepest and strangest of all human moods is the mood which will suddenly strike us perhaps in a garden at night, or deep in sloping meadows, the feeling that every flower and leaf has just uttered something stupendously direct and important, and that we have by a prodigy of imbecility not heard or understood it. There is a certain poetic value, and that a genuine one, in this sense of having missed the full meaning of things. There is beauty, not only in wisdom, but in this dazed and dramatic ignorance. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2011-04-22T06:12:38-07:00	We are in Eden still	quotes/we-are-in-eden-still.html	humanism, wonder	<p> There runs a strange law through the length of human history &#8212; that men are continually tending to undervalue their environment, to undervalue their happiness, to undervalue themselves. The great sin of mankind, the sin typified by the fall of Adam, is the tendency, not towards pride, but towards this weird and horrible humility. </p> <p> This is the great fall, the fall by which the fish forgets the sea, the ox forgets the meadow, the clerk forgets the city, every man forgets his environment and, in the fullest and most literal sense, forgets himself. This is the real fall of Adam, and it is a spiritual fall. It is a strange thing that many truly spiritual men, such as General Gordon, have actually spent some hours in speculating upon the precise location of the Garden of Eden. Most probably we are in Eden still. It is only our eyes that have changed. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2014-04-09T18:54:37-07:00	Symbolic Language	quotes/symbolic-language.html	critical thinking, humanism, written word	<p> At the moment, the most powerful marker, the feature that distinguishes our species most decisively from closely related species, appears to be symbolic language. Many animals can communicate with each other and share information in rudimentary ways. But humans are the only creatures who can communicate using symbolic language: a system of arbitrary symbols that can be linked by formal grammars to create a nearly limitless variety of precise utterances. Symbolic language greatly enhanced the precision of human communication and the range of ideas that humans can exchange. Symbolic language allowed people for the first time to talk about entities that were not immediately present (including experiences and events in the past and future) as well as entities whose existence was not certain (such as souls, demons, and dreams). </p>

Quotes	Quotation	2012-06-10T06:47:13-07:00	Liberalism is not Socialism	quotes/liberalism-is-not-socialism.html	equality, governance, value creation	<p> Liberalism is not Socialism, and never will be. There is a great gulf fixed. It is not a gulf of method, it is a gulf of principle. … Socialism seeks to pull down wealth. Liberalism seeks to raise up poverty. Socialism would destroy private interests; Liberalism would preserve private interests in the only way in which they can be safely and justly preserved, namely by reconciling them with public right. Socialism would kill enterprise; Liberalism would rescue enterprise from the trammels of privilege and preference … Socialism exalts the rule; Liberalism exalts the man. Socialism attacks capital; Liberalism attacks monopoly. </p>

The divine gift of purely nonsensical speech and action is in atrophy. Would you believe it, a pupil of mine had the impertinence the other day to tick me off for reading him passages regarding the Fimble Fowl and the Quangle-Wangle as an illustration of pure poetic inventiveness; I put him in his place all right.&#8221; In the semi-darkness his eye became momentarily lambent with remembered satisfaction. &#8220;But there's no eccentricity nowadays &#8212; none at all.&#8221; </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2007-09-08T10:13:31-07:00	Evolutionary Drive Towards Complexity	quotes/evolutionary-drive-towards-complexity.html	evolution	<p> The evolutionary drive towards complexity comes, in those lineages where it comes at all, not from any inherent propensity for increased complexity, and not from biased mutation. It comes from natural selection: the process which, as far as we know, is the only process ultimately capable of generating complexity out of simplicity. </p>

Quotes	Quotation	2010-08-13T18:30:01-07:00	Moral Religion	quotes/moral-religion.html	cultural evolution, religion, rule of law	<p> The Jewish scriptures admirably illustrate the development from the religion of fear to moral religion, a development continued in the New Testament. The religions of all civilized peoples, especially the peoples of the Orient, are primarily moral religions. The development from a religion of fear to moral religion is a great step in peoples&#8217; lives. And yet, that primitive religions are based entirely on fear and the religions of civilized peoples purely on morality is a prejudice against which we must be on our guard. The truth is that all religions are a varying blend of both types, with this differentiation: that on the higher levels of social life the religion of morality predominates. </p>

Quotes	Quotation	2012-11-06T04:07:51-08:00	The Mysterious	quotes/the-mysterious.html	art, religion, science, wonder	<p> The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science. Whoever does not know it and can no longer wonder, no longer marvel, is as good as dead, and his eyes are dimmed. It was the experience of mystery &#8212; even if mixed with fear &#8212; that engendered religion. A knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate, our perceptions of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty, which only in their most primitive forms are accessible to our minds: it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute true religiosity. In this sense, and only this sense, I am a deeply religious man. </p>

Quotes	Quotation	2010-08-13T18:22:37-07:00	This Highest Kind of Religious Feeling	quotes/this-highest-kind-of-religious-feeling.html	cultural evolution, religion, wonder	<p> The beginnings of cosmic religious feeling already appear at an early stage of development, e.g., in many of the Psalms of David and in some of the Prophets. Buddhism, as we have learned especially from the wonderful writings of Schopenhauer, contains a much stronger element of this. The religious geniuses of all ages have been distinguished by this kind of religious feeling, which knows no dogma and no God conceived in man's image; so that there can be no church whose central teachings are based on it. Hence it is precisely among the heretics of every age that we find men who were filled with this highest kind of religious feeling and were in many cases regarded by their contemporaries as atheists, sometimes also as saints. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2008-07-13T08:59:35-07:00	To Give in the Same Measure	quotes/to-give-in-the-same-measure.html	connection, mission	<p> How strange is the lot of us mortals! Each of us is here for a brief sojourn; for what purpose he knows not, though he sometimes thinks he senses it. But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people &#8212; first of all for those upon whose smiles and well-being our own happiness is wholly dependent, and then for the many, unknown to us, to whose destinies we are bound by the ties of sympathy. A hundred times every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labors of other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving.... </p>

The mediocre mind is incapable of understanding the man who refuses to bow blindly to conventional prejudices and chooses instead to express his opinions courageously and honestly. </p>

Quotes	Quotation	2008-06-08T20:05:24-07:00	A First-Rate Intelligence	quotes/a-first-rate-intelligence.html	critical thinking	<p> The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function. One should, for example, be able to see that things are hopeless yet be determined to make them otherwise. </p>

Without it we are meaningless fragments, half monks, half beasts, unconnected arches that have never joined into a man. With it love is born, and alights on the highest curve, glowing against the gray, sober against the fire. </p>

But they retain the power of wriggling, of fighting with their star or against it, and in the whole universe the only really interesting movement is this wriggle. </p>

We don't like to hear anybody say thanks for that. What I get today you may get tomorrow. Up here we say that by gifts one makes slaves and by whips one makes dogs.&#8217; </p>

All of these lessons are prime training for permanent underclasses, people deprived forever of finding the center of their own special genius. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2006-11-30T14:29:31-08:00	Climate Changers	quotes/climate-changers.html	population	<p> We urgently need to stabilise and reduce human numbers. There is no way that a population of nine billion &#8212; the UN's medium forecast for 2050 &#8212; can meet its energy needs without unacceptable damage to the planet and a great deal of human misery. We need to think about climate changers &#8212; human beings and their numbers &#8212; as well as climate change. It is the elephant in the room that nobody wants to talk about. Unless we reduce the human population humanely through family planning, nature will do it for us through violence, epidemics or starvation. </p>

Thinking's a dizzy business, a matter of catching as many of those foggy glimpses as you can and fitting them together the best you can. That's why people hang on so tight to their beliefs and opinions; because, compared to the haphazard way in which they're arrived at, even the goofiest opinion seems wonderfully clear, sane and self-evident. And if you let it get away from you, then you've got to dive back into that foggy muddle to wrangle yourself out another to take its place. </p>

Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, there hasn't been a single natural way of life for Sapiens. There are only cultural choices, from among a bewildering palette of possibilities. </p>

The functionaries of every government have propensities to command at will the liberty and property of their constituents. There is no safe deposit for these but with the people themselves; nor can they be safe with them without information. Where the press is free, and every man able to read, all is safe. </p>

The reason I say that is because each of the key people in the Beatles kept the others from going off in the directions of their bad tendencies. </p> <p> They sort of kept each other in check. And then when they split up, they never did anything as good. It was the chemistry of a small group of people, and that chemistry was greater than the sum of the parts. </p>

Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. </p> <p> That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. </p>

It's technology married with the liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields the results that makes our hearts sing. </p> <p> Nowhere is that more true than in these post-PC devices… that need to be even easier to use than a PC, that need to be even more intuitive than a PC; and where the software and the hardware and the applications need to intertwine in an even more seamless way than they do on a PC. </p> <p> We think we are on the right track with this. We think we have the right architecture not just in silicon but in the organization to build these kinds of products. </p>

Then you get into the problem, and you see that it's really complicated, and you come up with all these convoluted solutions. That's sort of the middle, and that's where most people stop.... But the really great person will keep on going and find the key, the underlying principle of the problem &#8212; and come up with an elegant, really beautiful solution that works. That's what we wanted to do with Mac. </p>

No, you see you can't. If you want to hire great people and have them stay working for you, you have to let them make a lot of decisions and you have to, you have to be run by ideas, not hierarchy. The best ideas have to win, otherwise good people don't stay. </p> <p> Mossberg: But you must be more than a facilitator who runs meetings. You obviously contribute your own ideas. </p> <p> Jobs: I contribute ideas, sure. Why would I be there if I didn't? </p>

Too often we hold fast to the clichés of our forebears. We subject all facts to a prefabricated set of interpretations. We enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought. </p>

It said that Nothing Ever Happened, so don't worry. It's all like a dream. Everything is ecstasy, inside. We just don't know it because of our thinking-minds. But in our true blissful essence of mind is known that everything is alright forever and forever and forever. Close your eyes, let your hands and nerve-ends drop, stop breathing for 3 seconds, listen to the silence inside the illusion of the world, and you will remember the lesson you forgot, which was taught in immense milky way soft cloud innumerable worlds long ago and not even at all. It is all one vast awakened thing. I call it the golden eternity. It is perfect. </p>

Quotes	Quotation	2013-12-28T13:09:27-08:00	Critical Thinking Followed by Action	quotes/critical-thinking-followed-by-action.html	critical thinking, individuals, progress, stories	<p> Interviewer: What's the most important meditation we can do now? </p> <p> Dalai Lama: Critical thinking, followed by action. Discern what your world is. Know the plot, the scenario of this human drama. And then figure out where your talents might fit in to make a better world. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2012-03-23T06:15:29-07:00	Equals	quotes/equals.html	equality	<p> Was it better to have a guy who was better than the people I had in? To make the group stronger, or to let me be stronger? Instead of going for an individual thing we went for the strongest format — equals. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2013-03-01T04:39:35-08:00	More Popular than Jesus	quotes/more-popular-than-jesus.html	stories	<p> Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I'll be proved right. We're more popular than Jesus now; I don't know which will go first—rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll or Christianity. Jesus was all right but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2014-12-06T13:20:17-08:00	The Enormous Extension of our Being	quotes/the-enormous-extension-of-our-being.html	written word	<p> Those of us who have been true readers all our life seldom fully realize the enormous extension of our being which we owe to authors. We realize it best when we talk with an unliterary friend. He may be full of goodness and good sense but he inhabits a tiny world. In it, we should be suffocated. The man who is contented to be only himself, and therefore less a self, is in prison. My own eyes are not enough for me, I will see through those of others. Reality, even seen through the eyes of many, is not enough. I will see what others have invented. Even the eyes of all humanity are not enough. I regret that the brutes cannot write books. Very gladly would I learn what face things present to a mouse or a bee; more gladly still would I perceive the olfactory world charged with all the information and emotion it carries for a dog. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2011-12-03T08:28:38-08:00	Labor is the Superior of Capital	quotes/labor-is-the-superior-of-capital.html	governance, individuals, society	<p> Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2012-01-19T13:34:08-08:00	Introduction of a new order of things	quotes/introduction-of-a-new-order-of-things.html	progress	<p> And it ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things. Because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new. This coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2008-10-07T18:07:48-07:00	Balance is Required to Maintain Democracy	quotes/balance-is-required-to-maintain-democracy.html	balance, governance	<p> Our current lack of respect for the swing can be likened to the current state of our democracy. Balance is required to maintain something as delicate as democracy, a subtle understanding of how your power can be magnified through joining with and sharing the power of another person. When that is no longer understood, it becomes a battle to see who is the strongest, who is the loudest, who can get the most attention. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2008-10-20T13:28:13-07:00	Inextricably Linked in Freedom	quotes/inextricably-linked-in-freedom.html	cultural evolution, liberty	<p> The originators of jazz were only two generations removed from slavery. They were victims of rigorous forms of segregation that routinely and institutionally denied their humanity. So freedom was much more than a word to them. These pioneering musicians were exuberant about exhibiting this newfound personal freedom through their art. But they were also excited about hearing other people do the same thing. They understood that all were inextricably linked in freedom, just as they had been inextricably linked in bondage. And it wasn't theory; it was life as they lived it. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2008-10-20T14:01:54-07:00	Integrity and Conviction	quotes/integrity-and-conviction.html	love	<p> The best jazz had always been the embodiment of integrity and conviction. Because the musicians&#8217; skills and competence were so hard-earned, it was difficult to get them to compromise. Once jazzmen began making the decision to water down their artistry for notoriety, publicity, or money, our art began to face the same challenges that our government and many businesses face: dearth of leadership, lack of quality, loss of meaning, insensitivity to people&#8212;ultimately a wholesale loss of faith: &#8216;Well, what is jazz, anyway?&#8217;'What difference does it make what I play?&#8217; </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2008-10-07T18:07:48-07:00	The Challenge of Swing	quotes/the-challenge-of-swing.html	connection, liberty	<p> Swing&#8212;the dance and the music&#8212;bespeaks the flexible nature of American life. In jazz, the bass walks a note on every beat. The drummer rides the cymbal or plays brushes on every beat. And everybody else invents melodies and sounds that sway with, against, and upside every beat. Every beat requires musicians to reassess their relationships to one another. This is what makes swinging so challenging. You are forced to be constantly aware of other people's feelings. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2010-10-23T11:28:26-07:00	The Love of What We are Doing	quotes/the-love-of-what-we-are-doing.html	love	<p> It's a labor of love for all of us. It's not contrived or fake and it's not about money (it's too much work to be about money). It's about the love of what we are doing. That's the center of what it is about, and that's the center of what anything of great human value is always about. It's about that love that you have for humanity in our commonality. And to experience all of the things that are in this music like heartbreak and joy and many other things &#8212; a certain type of striving and struggle &#8212; it's a part of the life we all live together. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2008-10-20T13:51:42-07:00	The Philosophy of Jazz	quotes/the-philosophy-of-jazz.html	equality, individuals, liberty	<p> Jazz is the most flexible art form ever because it believes in the good taste of individuals. It believes in our ability to make reasonable choices. It takes a chance on our decision-making skills instead of legislating our freedom away with written restrictions and restrictive hierarchies. In jazz, the size of your heart and your ability to play determine your position in the band. The philosophy of jazz is rooted in the elevation and enrichment of people, plain ol&#8217; folks. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2008-10-07T18:07:48-07:00	The Power of Art	quotes/the-power-of-art.html	art, progress	<p> When I started learning about jazz, I wasn't into any kind of art. I had no idea it could have a practical purpose. Now, more than thirty years later, I testify to the power of art, and more specifically jazz, to improve your life&#8212;and keep on improving it. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2008-10-20T13:39:30-07:00	The Undisputed Sovereignty of the Human Being	quotes/the-undisputed-sovereignty-of-the-human-being.html	art, humanism, individuals	<p> Jazz insists on the undisputed sovereignty of the human being. In this technological era we can easily be fooled into believing that sophisticated machines are more important than progressive humanity. That's why art is an important barometer of identity. The arts let us know who we are in all of our glory, reveal the best of who we are. All the political and financial might in the world is diminished when put to the service of an impoverished cultural agenda. We see it in our schools, in our homes, and in our world profile: rich and fat, lazy and morally corrupt, with wild, out-of-control young people. </p> <p> We all know that civilization requires a supreme effort. Our technology will become outmoded, but the technology of the human soul does not change. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2008-07-30T19:48:15-07:00	A book is a man's best friend	quotes/a-book-is-a-mans-best-friend.html	written word	<p> Outside of a dog, a book is a man's best friend. </p> <p> Inside of a dog, it's too dark to read. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2014-09-27T07:12:08-07:00	The original naiveté	quotes/the-original-naivet.html	art, love, wonder	<p> You study, you learn, but you guard the original naiveté. It has to be within you, as desire for drink is within the drunkard or love is within the lover. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2012-06-09T10:05:11-07:00	The Ultimate Democracy	quotes/the-ultimate-democracy.html	democracy, equality	<p> ... we were the ultimate democracy. If one of us didn't like a tune, we didn't play it. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2006-11-30T14:29:31-08:00	Changing the World	quotes/changing-the-world.html	cultural evolution, individuals, progress	<p> Never doubt that a small, group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2006-11-30T14:29:31-08:00	Quality of Children vs. Quantity	quotes/quality-of-children-vs-quantity.html	education, parenthood, population	<p> Instead of needing lots of children, we need high-quality children. </p>

Quotes	Quotation	2006-11-30T14:29:31-08:00	Every Third American	quotes/every-third-american.html	liberty	<p> We are, in fact, a nation of evangelists; every third American devotes himself to improving and lifting up his fellow citizens, usually by force; the messianic delusion is our national disease. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2008-07-30T19:37:55-07:00	We Must Respect the Other Fellow's Religion	quotes/we-must-respect-the-other-fellows-religion.html	critical thinking, equality, religion	<p> We must respect the other fellow's religion, but only in the sense and to the extent that we respect his theory that his wife is beautiful and his children smart. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2006-11-30T14:29:31-08:00	Intellectual Debate	quotes/intellectual-debate.html	critical thinking	<p> In all intellectual debates, both sides tend to be correct in what they affirm, and wrong in what they deny. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2006-11-30T14:29:31-08:00	Enemies of Art and Artist	quotes/enemies-of-art-and-artist.html	art	<p> Men are not suffering from the lack of good literature, good art, good theatre, good music, but from that which has made it impossible for these to become manifest. In short, they are suffering from the silent, shameful conspiracy (the more shameful since it is unacknowledged) which has bound them together as enemies of art and artist. They are suffering from the fact that art is not the primary moving force in their lives. They are suffering from the act, repeated daily, of keeping up the pretense that they can go their way, lead their lives, without art. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2013-03-21T18:27:09-07:00	This dear fucked-up planet	quotes/this-dear-fucked-up-planet.html	connection, love, progress	<p> What are we here for if not to enjoy life eternal, solve what problems we can, give light, peace and joy to our fellow-man, and leave this dear fucked-up planet a little healthier than when we were born? </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2013-06-27T04:12:18-07:00	We All Derive From the Same Source	quotes/we-all-derive-from-the-same-source.html	art, equality, humanism, individuals	<p> Every day we slaughter our finest impulses. That is why we get a heartache when we read those lines written by the hand of a master and recognize them as our own, as the tender shoots which we stifled because we lacked the faith to believe in our own powers, our own criterion of truth and beauty. Every man, when he gets quiet, when he becomes desperately honest with himself, is capable of uttering profound truths. We all derive from the same source. there is no mystery about the origin of things. We are all part of creation, all kings, all poets, all musicians; we have only to open up, only to discover what is already there. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2011-06-24T20:17:22-07:00	Quality Matters	quotes/quality-matters.html	education	<p> Quality matters, and much of the evidence suggests that while developing countries are encouraging and fostering meritocracy, their Western rivals are increasingly approaching academe with an egalitarian flare &#8212; more access (of course, with the benefit of widening educational opportunity) even if at the expense of quality. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2010-04-16T22:12:13-07:00	Hard Discipline of Reasonableness and Honesty	quotes/hard-discipline-of-reasonableness-and-honesty.html	critical thinking	<p> The great thing to remember is that the mind of man cannot be enlightened permanently by merely teaching him to reject some particular set of superstitions. There is an infinite supply of other superstitions always at hand; and the mind that desires such things, that is, the mind that has not trained itself to the hard discipline of reasonableness and honesty, will, as soon as its devils are cast out, proceed to fill itself with their relations. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2012-08-03T22:49:09-07:00	First they came...	quotes/first-they-came.html	connection, diversity, equality	<p> First they came for the communists, <br /> and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a communist. </p> <p> Then they came for the trade unionists, <br /> and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a trade unionist. </p> <p> Then they came for the Jews, <br /> and I didn't speak out because I wasn't a Jew. </p> <p> Then they came for me <br /> and there was no one left to speak out for me. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2009-01-20T20:47:20-08:00	A Return to These Truths	quotes/a-return-to-these-truths.html	progress	<p> Our challenges may be new. The instruments with which we meet them may be new. But those values upon which our success depends &#8212; hard work and honesty, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism &#8212; these things are old. These things are true. They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history. What is demanded then is a return to these truths. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2009-04-02T19:50:16-07:00	The Makers of Things	quotes/the-makers-of-things.html	cultural evolution, individuals, progress	<p> In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given. It must be earned. Our journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for less. It has not been the path for the faint-hearted &#8212; for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things &#8212; some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2009-02-04T07:47:47-08:00	The Third Place	quotes/the-third-place.html	connection	<p> Most needed are those &#8216;third places&#8217; which lend a public balance to the increased privatization of home life. Third places are nothing more than informal public gathering places. The phrase &#8216;third places&#8217; derives from considering our homes to be the &#8216;first&#8217; places in our lives, and our work places the &#8216;second.&#8217; </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2014-07-21T18:10:29-07:00	Politics and the Debasement of Language	quotes/politics-and-the-debasement-of-language.html	critical thinking, written word	<p> A scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he writes, will ask himself at least four questions, thus: What am I trying to say? What words will express it? What image or idiom will make it clearer? Is this image fresh enough to have an effect? And he will probably ask himself two more: Could I put it more shortly? Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly? But you are not obliged to go to all this trouble. You can shirk it by simply throwing your mind open and letting the ready-made phrases come crowding in. They will construct your sentences for you &#8212; even think your thoughts for you, to a certain extent &#8212; and at need they will perform the important service of partially concealing your meaning even from yourself. It is at this point that the special connection between politics and the debasement of language becomes clear. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2014-07-20T07:26:46-07:00	The Web of Life	quotes/the-web-of-life.html	connection	<p> Humankind has not woven the web of life. We are but one thread within it. Whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves. All things are bound together. All things connect. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2006-11-30T14:29:32-08:00	Freedom of Expression in Business	quotes/freedom-of-expression-in-business.html	connection, liberty	<p> ...note that this implicit recognition of the right-side traits by the excellent companies is directly at the expense of more traditional left-brain business practices: causes to fight for are a long way from thirty quarterly MBO objectives. The intimate team or small division ignores scale economies. Allowing freedom of expression by thousands of quality circles flies in the face of the &#8216;one best way&#8217; of traditional production organization. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2009-01-06T19:42:52-08:00	Postel’s Law	quotes/postels-law.html	diversity, liberty	<p> Be conservative in what you do; be liberal in what you accept from others. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2010-10-31T18:30:54-07:00	Ism-mania	quotes/ism-mania.html	diversity	<p> Grandpa: Penny why don't you write a play about ism-mania? </p> <p> Penny: Ism-mania? </p> <p> Grandpa: Yeah, sure, you know &#8212; communism, fascism, voodooism. Everybody's got an ism these days. </p> <p> Penny: I feel like I've got this itch or something. </p> <p> Grandpa: It's just as catching. When things go a little bad nowadays, you go out and get yourself an ism and you're in business. </p> <p> Penny: I've got it! It might help Cynthia to have an ism in the monastery! </p> <p> Grandpa: It might at that. Only give her Americanism. Let her know something about Americans: John Paul Jones, Patrick Henry, Samuel Adams, Washington, Jefferson, Monroe, Lincoln, Grant, Lee, Edison, Mark Twain. When things got tough for those boys, they didn't run around looking for isms. Lincoln said, &#8220;With malice toward none, with charity for all.&#8221; Nowadays they say, &#8220;Think the way I do, or I'll bomb the daylights out of you.&#8221; </p>

The adjective in the lotus. The jewel in the inkwell. A blue dolphin leaping from a sink of dirty dishes. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2007-05-26T21:32:40-07:00	The World is a Wonderfully Weird Place	quotes/the-world-is-a-wonderfully-weird-place.html	liberty, love, wonder	<p> The world is a wonderfully weird place, consensual reality is significantly flawed, no institution can be trusted, certainty is a mirage, security a delusion, and the tyranny of the dull mind forever threatens &#8212; but our lives are not as limited as we think they are, all things are possible, laughter is holier than piety, freedom is sweeter than fame, and in the end it's love and love alone that really matters. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2011-10-30T11:35:29-07:00	Unbelievable Heroes	quotes/unbelievable-heroes.html	stories	<p> There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old's life: The <cite>Lord of the Rings</cite> and <cite>Atlas Shrugged</cite>. One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world. The other, of course, involves orcs. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2015-08-30T14:24:57-07:00	Great minds discuss ideas	quotes/great-minds-discuss-ideas.html	critical thinking	<p> Great minds discuss ideas, average ones discuss events, and small minds discuss people. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2006-11-30T14:29:31-08:00	Men Fear Thought	quotes/men-fear-thought.html	critical thinking, liberty	<p> Men fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth &#8212; more than ruin &#8212; more even than death.... Thought is subversive and revolutionary, destructive and terrible, thought is merciless to privilege, established institutions, and comfortable habit. Thought looks into the pit of hell and is not afraid. Thought is great and swift and free, the light of the world, and the chief glory of man. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2012-08-03T23:01:54-07:00	Ten Commandments for Teachers	quotes/ten-commandments-for-teachers.html	critical thinking, diversity, education, liberty	<p> 1. Do not feel absolutely certain of anything. </p> <p> 2. Do not think it worth while to proceed by concealing evidence, for the evidence is sure to come to light. </p> <p> 3. Never try to discourage thinking for you are sure to succeed. </p> <p> 4. When you meet with opposition, even if it should be from your husband or your children, endeavour to overcome it by argument and not by authority, for a victory dependent upon authority is unreal and illusory. </p> <p> 5. Have no respect for the authority of others, for there are always contrary authorities to be found. </p> <p> 6. Do not use power to suppress opinions you think pernicious, for if you do the opinions will suppress you. </p> <p> 7. Do not fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric. </p> <p> 8. Find more pleasure in intelligent dissent that in passive agreement, for, if you value intelligence as you should, the former implies a deeper agreement than the latter. </p> <p> 9. Be scrupulously truthful, even if the truth is inconvenient, for it is more inconvenient when you try to conceal it. </p> <p> 10. Do not feel envious of the happiness of those who live in a fool's paradise, for only a fool will think that it is happiness. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2007-09-08T10:21:56-07:00	The Celestial Teapot	quotes/the-celestial-teapot.html	critical thinking, religion	<p> Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of skeptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatics to prove them. This is, of course, a mistake. If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2007-10-08T19:40:58-07:00	Apes and Humans	quotes/apes-and-humans.html	evolution, humanism, science	<p> Philosophers and scientists confidently offer up traits said to be uniquely human, and the apes casually knock them down &#8212; toppling the pretension that humans constitute some sort of biological aristocracy among the beings of Earth. Instead, we are more like the nouveau riche, incompletely accommodated to our recent exalted state, insecure about who we are, and trying to put as much distance as possible between us and our humble origins. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2007-10-08T19:33:03-07:00	Chimps and Humans	quotes/chimps-and-humans.html	humanism, science	<p> On the basis of all the evidence, the closest relative of the human proves to be the chimp. The closest relative of the chimp is the human. Not orangs, but people. Us. Chimps and humans are nearer kin than are chimps and gorillas or any other kinds of ape not of the same species. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2014-10-31T19:17:06-07:00	To prolong our presence on the face of the Earth	quotes/to-prolong-our-presence-on-the-face-of-the-earth.html	critical thinking, humanism, mission	<p> What we're doing now is trying to think like nature, in the sense that we are aware that species that have gone before us have disappeared from the face of the Earth. We'd like to use our intelligence and our creative capacity to prolong our presence on the face of the Earth as long as possible. It requires, therefore, that we develop the kinds of tactics and strategies amongst ourselves so as to assure that this can occur, to assure that we will not destroy ourselves or the planet, to make it uninhabitable and to allow the fullness of the potential of the individual to be expressed, to flower. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2007-11-13T17:53:40-08:00	Progress Depends on Retentiveness	quotes/progress-depends-on-retentiveness.html	progress	<p> Progress, far from consisting in change, depends on retentiveness. When change is absolute there remains no being to improve and no direction is set for possible improvement: and when experience is not retained, as among savages, infancy is perpetual. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2016-04-26T09:02:12-07:00	Only Two Sources of Real Wealth	quotes/only-two-sources-of-real-wealth.html	individuals, value creation	<p> We have had to learn the bitter lesson that in all the world there are only two sources of real wealth: the fruit of the earth and the labor of men; and to estimate work not by the money it brings to the producer, but by the worth of the thing that is made. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2006-11-30T14:29:31-08:00	Small and Obscure Deeds	quotes/small-and-obscure-deeds.html	individuals, progress	<p> Of all the will toward the ideal in mankind only a small part can manifest itself in public action. All the rest of this force must be content with small and obscure deeds. The sum of these, however, is a thousand times stronger than the acts of those who receive wide public recognition. The latter, compared to the former, are like the foam on the waves of a deep ocean. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2006-11-30T14:29:32-08:00	Learning from Experience	quotes/learning-from-experience.html	critical thinking, education	<p> The most powerful learning comes from direct experience. But what happens when we can no longer observe the consequences of our actions? Herein lies the core <em>learning dilemma</em> that confronts organizations:<em> we learn best from experience but we never directly experience the consequences of many of our most important decisions.</em> The most critical decisions made in organizations have systemwide consequences that stretch over years or decades. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2011-08-01T12:42:03-07:00	ESPN president meets Steve Jobs	quotes/espn-president-meets-steve-jobs.html	critical thinking, equality	<p> The story goes that ESPN president George Bodenheimer attended the first Disney board meeting in Orlando, Florida, just after the company had bought Pixar, the innovative animation factory, and spotted Apple CEO Steve Jobs in a hallway. It seemed like a good time to introduce himself. &#8220;I am George Bodenheimer,&#8221; he said to Jobs. &#8220;I run ESPN.&#8221; Jobs just looked at him and said nothing other than &#8220;Your phone is the dumbest fucking idea I have ever heard,&#8221; then turned and walked away. </p>

Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2010-07-12T15:10:39-07:00	Freedom of Judgment	quotes/freedom-of-judgment.html	liberty, society	<p> Since we have the rare good fortune to live in a commonwealth where the freedom of judgment is fully granted to the individual citizen and he may worship God as he pleases, and where nothing is esteemed dearer and more precious than freedom, I think I am undertaking no ungrateful or unprofitable task in demonstrating that not only can this freedom be granted without endangering piety and the peace of the commonwealth, but also the peace of the commonwealth and piety depend on this freedom. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2010-07-12T15:03:19-07:00	Notions to Explain Nature	quotes/notions-to-explain-nature.html	science	<p> We see therefore that all the notions whereby the common people are wont to explain Nature are merely modes of imagining and denote not the nature of anything but only the constitution of the imagination. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2007-12-02T13:10:14-08:00	A Long Conversation	quotes/a-long-conversation.html	art, connection	<p> At this point, I'm in the middle of a very long conversation with my audience. </p> <p> It's an ongoing dialogue about what living means. You create a space together. You are involved in an act of the imagination together, imagining the life you want to live, the kind of country you want to live in, the kind of place you want to leave to your children. What are the things that bring you ecstasy and bliss, what are the things that bring on the darkness, and what can we do together to combat those things? That's the dialogue I have in my imagination when I'm writing. I have it in front of me when I'm performing. </p>

It was really quite the opposite. They assumed they knew the answer. They assumed the foam was not going to be a problem. And they were insisting that people disprove the preconception they had.&#8217; </p>

Quotes	Quotation	2010-02-27T13:29:06-08:00	A Work Ethic Gone Mad	quotes/a-work-ethic-gone-mad.html	balance, humanism	<p> The blend of corporate mysticism and transcendental consumerism he [Tom Peters] offers has its roots planted in the pragmatic, optimistic, can-do American work ethic. But, like the Taylorist philosophy from which it springs, it is also a work ethic gone mad. It begins with the idea that work can be meaningful and stretches it to the point where there is no meaning outside work. It becomes a deluded form of optimism, a feverish activity that masks an underlying anxiety about the meaning of life, a form of self-alienation so complete that the self disappears entirely into its consumer preferences and transactions. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2010-02-27T13:07:00-08:00	Preparing Managers to Manage	quotes/preparing-managers-to-manage.html	education	<p> The time has come to recognize that higher education in management rests on a fatal fallacy. The idea behind the contemporary business school is that preparing future business managers means training them in a discipline called Business Management. After 100 years of fruitless attempts to produce such a discipline, it should be clear that it does not exist. Preparing managers to manage, in fact, is not different from preparing people to live in a civilized world. Managers do not need to be trained; they need to be <em>educated.</em> And for that purpose, although a certain amount of study of business-related subjects may prove useful, the business schools as they are presently constituted are at best superfluous. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2010-02-27T12:42:19-08:00	Relieving Ignorance	quotes/relieving-ignorance.html	education	<p> &#8220;Customer satisfaction&#8221; is a good way to sell shoes; but it is a bad way to relieve ignorance. It is fundamentally stupid to base the content of an education on what the as-yet uneducated person decides is best. </p>

Quotes	Quotation	2013-12-12T09:11:11-08:00	Myth-Makers	quotes/myth-makers.html	stories, written word	<p> It's only recently that I've come to understand that writers are not marginal to our society, that they, in fact, do all our thinking for us, that we are writing myths and our myths are believed, and that old myths are believed until someone writes a new one. </p> <p> ... </p> <p> I think writers should be more responsible than they are, as we've imagined for a long time that it really doesn't matter what we say. . . . I think it's a beginning for authors to acknowledge that they are myth-makers and that if they are widely read, will have an influence that will last for many years &#8212; I don't think that there's a strong awareness of that now, and we have such a young culture that there is an opportunity to contribute wonderful new myths to it, which will be accepted. </p>

Quotes	Quotation	2012-01-09T17:37:44-08:00	A Coke is a Coke	quotes/a-coke-is-a-coke.html	equality	<p> What's great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest. You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coke, Liz Taylor drinks Coke, and just think, you can drink Coke, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good. Liz Taylor knows it, the President knows it, the bum knows it, and you know it. </p>

The comfortable assistant, the nice guy you like to go on fishing trips with, is a great pitfall. Instead I looked for those sharp, scratchy, harsh, almost unpleasant guys who see and tell you about things as they really are. If you can get enough of them around you and have patience enough to hear them out, there is no limit to where you can go. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2011-12-29T08:50:31-08:00	Shareholder Value	quotes/shareholder-value.html	value creation	<p> On the face of it, shareholder value is the dumbest idea in the world. Shareholder value is a result, not a strategy... your main constituencies are your employees, your customers and your products. Managers and investors should not set share price increases as their overarching goal. ... Short-term profits should be allied with an increase in the long-term value of a company. </p>

Study not only their productions. There is a still higher school for him who would kindle his fire with coal from the altar of the loftiest and purest art. It is the school of all grand actions and grand virtues, of heroism, of the death of patriots and martyrs &#8212; of all the mighty deeds written in the pages of history &#8212; deeds of daring, and enthusiasm, devotion, and fortitude. </p>

Quotes	Quotation	2007-02-11T09:48:55-08:00	An Integral God	quotes/an-integral-god.html	integral, religion	<p> An archaic God sees divinity in any strong instinctual force. A magic God locates divine power in the human ego and its magical capacity to change the animistic world with rituals and spells. A mythic God is located not on this earth but in a heavenly paradise not of this world, entrance to which is gained by living according to the covenants and rules given by this God to his peoples. A mental God is a rational God, a demythologized Ground of Being that underlies all forms of existence. And an integral God is one that embraces all of the above. </p>

Quotes	Quotation	2007-02-10T15:04:57-08:00	Everybody Has Some Important Pieces of the Truth	quotes/everybody-has-some-important-pieces-of-the-truth.html	integral	<p> My work is an attempt to make room in the Kosmos for all of the dimensions, levels, domains, waves, memes, modes, individuals, cultures, and so on ad infinitum. I have one major rule: Everybody is right. More specifically, everybody — including me — has some important pieces of truth, and all of those pieces need to be honored, cherished, and included in a more gracious, spacious, and compassionate embrace. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2007-02-11T09:51:34-08:00	Homophobia	quotes/homophobia.html	cultural evolution, diversity	<p> An integral approach acknowledges that all views have a degree of truth, but some views are more true than others, more evolved, more developed, more adequate. And so let's get that part out of the way right now: homophobia in any form, as far as I can tell, stems from a lower level of human development &#8212; but it is a level, it exists, and one has to make room in one's awareness for those lower levels as well, just as one has to include third grade in any school curriculum. Just don't, you know, put those people in charge of anything important. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2008-10-19T09:28:50-07:00	Levels of Development	quotes/levels-of-development.html	cultural evolution	<p> To grasp what is involved with levels or stages, let's use a very simple model possessing only 3 of them. If we look at moral development, for example, we find that an infant at birth has not yet been socialized into the culture's ethics and conventions: this is called the <strong>preconventional stage</strong>. It is also called <strong>egocentric</strong>, in that the infant's awareness is largely self-absorbed. But as the young child begins to learns its culture's rules and norms, it grows into the <strong>conventional stage</strong> of morals. This stage is also called <strong>ethnocentric</strong>, in that it centers on the child's particular group, tribe, clan, or nation, and it therefore tends to exclude those not of its group. But at the next major stage of moral development, the <strong>postconventional stage</strong>, the individual's identity expands once again, this time to include a care and concern for all peoples, regardless of race, color, sex or creed, which is why this stage is also called <strong>worldcentric</strong>. </p> <p> Thus, moral development tends to move from &#8216;me&#8217; (egocentric) to &#8216;us&#8217; (ethnocentric) to &#8216;all of us&#8217; (worldcentric)&#8212;a good example of the unfolding waves of consciousness. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2007-02-11T09:42:57-08:00	The Beautiful, the Good and the True	quotes/the-beautiful-the-good-and-the-true.html	integral	<p> If you are talking to me about your new car, you are the first person, I am the second person, and the car is the third person. These pronouns actually represent three perspectives that human beings can take when they talk about the world or attempt to know the world.... The fascinating part is that these three perspectives might actually give rise to art, morals, and science. Or the Beautiful, the Good, and the True: the Beauty that is in the eye (or the I) of the beholder; the Good or moral actions that can exist between you and me as a we; and the objective Truth about third-person objects (or its) that you and I might discover: hence, art (I), morals (we), and science (it). </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2012-03-10T11:02:20-08:00	The Left Hand Dimension	quotes/the-left-hand-dimension.html	integral	<p> But the main point is that this Left Hand dimension refers to the inside, to the <em>interior depth</em> that is <em>consciousness</em> itself. </p> <p> Q: You said earlier that depth is consciousness, or what depth looked like from within. </p> <p> KW: Yes, exactly. The Left Hand is what the holon looks like from within; the Right Hand is what the same holon looks like from without. Interior and exterior. Consciousness and form. Subjective and objective. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2010-10-26T20:07:27-07:00	A Planet-Sized Problem	quotes/a-planet-sized-problem.html	population	<p> Few will doubt that humankind has created a planet-sized problem for itself. No one wished it so, but we are the first species to become a geophysical force, altering Earth's climate, a role previously reserved for tectonics, sun flares, and glacial cycles. We are also the greatest destroyer of life since the ten-kilometer-wide meteorite that landed near Yucatan and ended the Age of Reptiles sixty-five million years ago. Through overpopulation we have put ourselves in danger of running out of food and water. So a very Faustian choice is upon us: whether to accept our corrosive and risky behavior as the unavoidable price of population and economic growth, or to take stock of ourselves and search for a new environmental ethic. </p>
Quotes	Quotation	2010-10-26T20:04:13-07:00	The Most Dangerous of Devotions	quotes/the-most-dangerous-of-devotions.html	humanism, religion	<p> The most dangerous of devotions, in my opinion, is the one endemic to Christianity: <em>I was not born to be of this world.</em> With a second life waiting, suffering can be endured &#8212; especially in other people. The natural environment can be used up. Enemies of the faith can be savaged and suicidal martyrdom praised. </p>

Quotes	Quotation	2010-10-26T20:00:28-07:00	True Character	quotes/true-character.html	individuals, religion, society	<p> True character arises from a deeper well than religion. It is the internalization of moral principles of a society, augmented by those tenets personally chosen by the individual, strong enough to endure through trials of solitude and adversity. The principles are fitted together into what we call integrity, literally the integrated self, wherein personal decisions feel good and true. Character is in turn the enduring source of virtue. It stands by itself and excites admiration in others. It is not obedience to authority, and while it is often consistent with and reinforced by religious belief, it is not piety. </p>

None of the later structures  replace earlier ones, yet each new structure has been devised in order to confer some new sort of evolutionary advantage to our species -- in other words, to help us survive and thrive more effectively.

Blog	Blog Post	2013-12-15	Human Nature	blog/hbowie/human-nature.html	evolution, humanism, cultural evolution	What does it mean to be human? This must certainly be a foundational question for all of us, when  contemplating almost any aspect of our existence. And while any brief answer to this question must admittedly be no more than a starting point for further discussion, I think it perhaps worthwhile to provide such a beginning. And so, here they are: the primary traits we share that I think make us uniquely human.
Blog	Blog Post	2012-02-21	Reasons for Belief	blog/hbowie/reasons-for-belief.html	critical thinking, religion	We often seem to assume that people say things, and come to believe them, because they are true. It seems to me, though, that people take up beliefs for a whole host of reasons, and the likely truth or falsehood of these statements is often the least of the motivating factors at work. Here then, are the multifarious reasons why people may choose to believe something.

Wilber has described four quadrants of human knowledge, each representing a different and valid perspective on the same reality.
Blog	Blog Post	2012-03-10	The Nature of God	blog/hbowie/the-nature-of-god.html	critical thinking, religion	Human records indicate that some sort of belief in a God or collection of gods is a feature of almost all human culture. No matter what the continent or age, a belief in powerful, supernatural beings that somehow influence human existence is a near-constant. At the same time, though, many skeptics have persistently questioned the existence of such a being, and beliefs about the attributes of God have exhibited wide variation, with such variations often being so deeply held that wars have been fought to advance one sort of belief over another. Rather than approach the question of God's existence directly, it seems wiser to ask ourselves how we can best explain the facts above -- the combination of a nearly universal human belief in God, combined with so far irreconcilable differences in what sort of God we believe in.
Blog	Blog Post	2011-08-15	The Systemic Era	blog/hbowie/the-systemic-era.html	cultural evolution, systemic	We tend to divide up human history into relatively neat periods, and give them names like "The Agrarian Era," "The Age of Industrialization" and "The Information Age." When I look at what's going on around me today and try to make sense of it, I am forced to draw the conclusion that we are deep into an as yet unnamed age that I would call "The Systemic Era." What I mean by this is that we are now at a point where the human condition is much more influenced by vast social and economic systems of our own collective making than by any natural forces or conditions, or any individual actions we might take, or even any individual intentions we might have.
